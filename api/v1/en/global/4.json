The aim of the programme is to verify the practical application of knowledge acquired in and outside the school. The survey (representative) is carried out in randomly selected schools, and depending on the type of school, it covers randomly selected students aged 15-16 (results are generalized to the entire population). The success of the survey depends on the participation of all sampled schools and students. PISA standards only allow a small-scale denial.PISA tests students skills in three subject areas: reading, mathematics and science . The survey is carried out every three years, since 2000.  Poland has been participating in the study since its inception.PISA tests (developed by an international consortium, with the cooperation of the countries participating in the project) are different from typical school activities, and on the basis of the results, the level of student skills is estimated. The best students reach level 5 or 6 (ability to resolve tasks with a relatively high degree of difficulty), while results below level 2 - a minimum level of competence - indicate very basic skills, which means a higher risk of difficulties coping with education and adult life.PIRLS is the largest international study of reading comprehension in primary schools. The initiator and organizer of the study is the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) - an independent consortium of research organizations and government agencies from almost 70 member countries; in Poland it is coordinated by the Ministry of Education. The study involves students in their fourth year of schooling (due to the reforms in the compulsory school age in Poland, the achievements of third-graders were examined until 2011).The subject of measurement is reading in terms of literary experience (reading literary texts) and reading in order to obtain information (reading informational texts). The study has been carried out since 2001. Poland has been participating in the study since 2006.Based on the results obtained, the skill level of the student is estimated. The best students achieve level 5 (ability to separate important information from irrelevant information, drawing conclusions from premises scattered in the text, etc.), while results below level 2 - the minimum level of competence - indicate that they have only very basic skills (understanding only single sentences).Until 2016, the PIRLS survey in all countries was implemented only in a paper version. Since 2016, it is possible to carry out the survey in two versions: paper and digital. From 2026, the PIRLS survey will be conducted only in a digital version.",

According to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) the first question addressed to the respondent in the EHIS survey is self-assessment of health status, i.e. how a person perceives and evaluates his or her own health. In the case of adolescents and adults (aged 15 and over), a response was requested directly from the respondent. For children up to age 15, parents, legal guardians, and relatives may be able to provide information about them. The answer categories used in this question were: very good, good, so so (neither good nor bad), bad and very bad.",

Data for the indicator comes from the Study of the use of Information and Communication Technologies in households and by individuals. The study of the use of information and communication technologies in households and by individual users began in the European Union (EU) in 2002, using mainly the method of direct or telephone interview.In Poland, the study on the use of ICT in households according to a methodology harmonized with the EU began in 2004. It is carried out annually and participation in it is voluntary. The survey is carried out using the direct interview method, and from 2018 also via the online self-census method. It covers households with at least one person aged 16-74 and people at that age. The indicators relate to the percentage of people with total digital skills (by level: low, basic, secondary) and information, communication, problem solving and software skills (by level: basic, secondary). Data have been presented since 2015, when the digital skills methodology was last revised.The skill level is calculated on the basis of a list of activities related to the use of the computer, software or the Internet, including:   copying or moving a file or folder, use of spreadsheets, transferring files between your computer and other devices, changing the settings of any software or operating system, creating presentations or documents combining text, pictures, tables or graphs, sending and receiving e-mails.

Parity index is a ratio of one quantity to the other (within a given index). The quantity referring to the group in a less privileged situation is usually captured in the numerator of a fraction. When the index equals 1, there is equality between the groups. The more the index value differs from 1, the bigger the disproportion between the groups.  Gender parity index is a ratio of given index values for women and men.   The gender parity indices in education are calculated on the basis of the following indicators:  4.1.1.b Percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in reading   for gender parity index in reading at the end of lower-secondary school, 4.1.1.c Percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in mathematics - for gender parity index in mathematics at the end of lower-secondary school, 4.2.2 Participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age) - for gender parity index in pre-primary education for 6-year-old children.

The PIAAC study allows for directly measurement of three competencies: • literacy  • numeracy  • ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. In addition, PIAAC provides information about the relationship between skills and intensity of their use, education, educational activity and labor market situation. International Program of Adult Competencies is coordinated internationally by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and in Poland by the Institute for Educational Research. A representative of the Ministry of National Education represented Poland in a Board of Participating Countries, e.i. in a group that manages the development, implementation and monitoring of the study. In the first round of the PIAAC study (2008-2013) 24 countries were participating, out of which 22 are OECD members. A total of 166 thousand persons aged 16-65 were examined (including 9.4 thousand in Poland). Work on the study concept was undertaken in 2008. In most countries, the study covered the period from August 2011 to March 2012. Publication of results and completion of the first round of PIAAC took place in October 2013. The second round of study (2012-2016) covered 9 further countries and its results were announced in June 2016. Currently, the third round of study (2016-2019) is underway, which will concern the next 6 countries.and its results (international report and datasets) will be published in October 2023. The PIAAC study adopted a contractual scale of competence ranging from 0 to 500 points. This scale has been divided into: • 6 skill levels (1 to 5 and below 1) - in terms of literacy and numeracy • 4 skill levels (1 to 3 and 1 below) - in terms of ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. The higher the level, the better the skill. People with the highest level of understanding of text or mathematical reasoning are assigned 4 or 5 skill levels, and in terms of solving problems in technology-rich environments - level 3. In both cases, people with the weakest results are classified as 1 or less than 1.",

In addition,as follows from the the above regulation, public toilets require the separation of sanitary facilities for men and women [para. 85(1)] and the provision of hand washing devices [para. 84(2)]. The Regulation of the Minister of National Education and Sport of 31 December 2002 on safety and hygiene in public and non-public schools and institutions (Journal of Laws of 2003 No. 6, item 69, as amended) regulates access to drinking water. In the absence of a water supply network, another source of water that meets the requirements for drinking water is provided in schools and institutions. Taking into account the above regulations it should be assumed that 100% of schools in Poland have access to electricity and drinking water, as well as separate sanitary facilities for men and women and hand washing devices. Otherwise they could not be used for educational purposes. Data on the percentage of schools with computer labs and schools with access to the Internet are derived from the Education Information System of the Ministry of Education.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.

The grant element is calculated specifically for tied aid credits. Additionally, work  is underway to include other flows in ODA, e.g. amounts mobilized by the public sector  from private sector instruments. Moreover, since 2019, Poland has been reporting a new  TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) indicator, which measures the  support provided for the implementation of the SDGs at the global level.",

Employment of a person who does not meet the qualification requirements provided for by the provisions of the education law takes place only in exceptional circumstances.
