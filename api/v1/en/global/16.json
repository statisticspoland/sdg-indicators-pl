The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Respondents were asked 'How safe do you feel to be alone in your neighborhood after dark?' Possible answers were: very safe, rather safe, rather dangerous, very dangerous, do not go alone after dark, because I feel dangerous, do not go alone after dark for other reasons. To calculate the indicator, the category do not go alone after dark, because I feel dangerous was excluded.",

Apart from temporary arrest, the remaining preventive measures are non-custodial and include: guarantee, supervision, suspend in official or occupation, ban from leaving the country and stop driving licence. Temporary arrest can only be made by a court order and is a final measure only if another preventive measure is insufficient. Temporary arrest is carried out in remand prisons. Remand prisons may be created as independent remand prisons or as separate prisons. Detention centers are subject to the Minister of Justice.",

The Birth certificate is compiled by the Civil Status Office at the same day the birth declaration takes place. The birth certificate for the child includes, among others:  • name and surname of the child,  • country, date and place of birth,  • sex,  • surname, first and last names, date and place of birth of the parents of the child. Compiling a Birth certificate for the child allows to give the PESEL number that is necessary for its identification in state registers. Situations when the birth of a child is not reported to the civil status office are treated as crimes, and may involve the case of concealment of the child, i.e. when the birth of a child occurs without the involvement of a medical subject and then the child does not use health services, educational facilities, etc. (what means lack of knowledge of child's existence).",

In a survey carried out in 2015, respondents were asked: 'Would you consider to be a person belonging to a social group that for any reason is treated less favourably (discriminated) than other groups in Poland?' Possible answers were: yes or no. The aim of the social cohesion survey is to gather information allowing a comprehensive assessment of the quality of life (considering economic and social aspects), evaluated from the perspective of both objective and subjective indicators. Owing to the integration of individual data, it is possible to determine i.e. in which groups of the society there is an accumulation of favourable or unfavourable aspects of the quality of life, which factors determine these situations, and which relationships exist between various dimensions of the quality of life. A wide range of collected information enable e.g. to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the level and diversity of lifestyles as well as a multidimensional analysis of poverty, social exclusion, social capital and subjective well-being.",
