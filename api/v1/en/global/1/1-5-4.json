The priorities of the program are: 1. Understanding the risks associated with disasters. 2. Strengthening of disaster risk management to enable its management. 3. Investing in disaster risk reduction to strengthen resilience. 4. Improving the system of preparedness to respond effectively to disasters and 'better rehabilitation' for recovery, repair and reconstruction. National disaster risk reduction strategy, including natural disasters, in line with the Sendai Framework is a part of the Report on Threats to National Security. This report is updated periodically. Updates took place in 2015, 2018 and 2021. The main goals of the strategy are to reduce existing and future threats by performing risk assessment, alerting and building disaster resilience. Local disaster risk reduction strategies – voivodship’s partial reports for Report on Threats to National Security, compliant with national risk reduction strategy, are periodically updated and are one of the bases for developing Report on Threats to National Security. The main aim of these strategies is including local initiatives into the actions for disaster risk reduction (both natural and caused by the intentional human activity).",
