Water supply is a composite of engineering equipment and technical objects, whose task is to provide the population and industry in the water of the required quantities and properties corresponding to its destination. Requirements for the quality of water intended for human consumption, including bacteriological, physico-chemical and organoleptic characteristics determines the regulation of the Minister of Health of 13 November 2015 on the quality of water intended for human consumption (Journal of Laws of 2015, item 1989). Data on urban population connected to water supply and sewage systems comprise the population inhabiting residential buildings connected to a particular network. Due to a change in the estimation method, data from 2014, are not fully comparable with the data presented in previous years. The starting point for data estimation are the results of the National Census of Population and Housing. The data is then corrected by adding information on change of the number of completed buildings and the number of dwellings per one building (based on reports on residential buildings and dwellings in non-residential buildings completed and reports on losses of dwelling stock). The indicator of the number of persons per one dwelling comes from the balance of dwelling stocks. This is the number of actually residing population, as of December 31 in a given year, divided by the number of dwellings. Information on the newly connected or disconnected buildings is derived from the report on water supply system, sewage system and liquid waste stored in septic tanks.",
