Clean fuel is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion. The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices comes from about 1300 nationally representative survey and censuses. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), and other nationally developed and implemented surveys. Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a given country and year are obtained together using a single multivariate hierarchical model. Using household survey data as inputs, the model jointly estimates primary reliance on 6 specific fuel types:  ∙ unprocessed biomass (e.g. wood),   ∙ charcoal,   ∙ coal,   ∙ kerosene,   ∙ gaseous fuels (e.g. LPG),   ∙ electricity;   and a final category including other clean fuels (e.g. alcohol).",

Gross domestic energy consumption includes consumption of coal, electricity, crude oil, natural gas and renewable energy. Kgoe stands for kilogram of oil equivalent (contractual), which is a unit of measurement of energy used in international balance sheets.

ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recepients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into bilateral and multilateral. Bilateral assistance is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation. Multilateral assistance is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. The indicator is calculated on the basis of total ODA commitments identified by Rio markers for climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation with assigned scores 1 or 2.  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2016-2020 in accordance with which the focus of Polish developemnt cooperation has been placed on Eastern Partnership countries (Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) as well as Africa, Asia and Middle East (Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania, Myanmar and Palestine).Polish development cooperation supports strengthening the rule of law, decentralization reforms and combat against corruption as well as human and civil rights compliance. Its main objectives cover the improvement of health care, better access to education and support for entrepreneurship and agriculture as well as natural environment protection including natural disasters prevention. Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.",

Therefore, the indicator does not cover contributions to the general budgets of organisations, such as UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), which operate within the scope of climate change. Since 2018, the indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there will be no differentiation into net and gross ODA in that respect. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation."
