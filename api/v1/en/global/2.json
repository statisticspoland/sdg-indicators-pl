It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy deficit. The indicator is a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the households' ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time. Undernourishment is defined by FAO as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements. While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, the indicator can only be referred to a population, or group of individuals (due to conceptual considerations). The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in that group, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished.",

Standard Deviation - indicates how much the value of a given variable is dispersed around the average, which is median (growth to age) in the indicator in question. The lower the deviation value, the more observations are focused around the average. The indicator is calculated on the basis of information obtained from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS).

The plant genetic resources are calculated on the basis of the database containing the number of objects and associated data. Information is available at: http://egiset.ihar.edu.pl/index.aspx?lang=en-GB of IHAR-PIB. The database includes resources stored in the gene bank collections, in various forms, located at IHAR Radzików (central seed storage) and in a number of other institutions, including the Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice, the Arboretum and the Department of Physiography in Bolestraszyce  Polish Academy of Sciences Botanical Garden - Center for Biological Diversity Conservation in Powsin  Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW  Poznan University of Life Sciences  Society of Friends of the Lower Vistula River in Gruczno  Plant Breeding of Poznań LLC in Tulce  Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants in Poznań  Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation - NRI in Puławy. The number of  livestock genetic resources is calculated on the basis of ex situ in vitro and ex situ in vivo methods. There are the following methods to protect the animal population from extinction:  in situ - the protection of living animals in their natural environment, ex-situ-protection of genetic resources beyond their natural habitat, including:   ex-situ in vitro - cryopreserved material in banks of genetic material, ex situ in vivo - collections of live animals kept away from the place of occurrence  In the case of ex situ in vivo collections, in order for them to be considered long-term and stable, it is assumed that they are in public sector institutions.",

There are the following methods to protect the animal population from extinction:  in situ - the protection of living animals in their natural environment, ex-situ-protection of genetic resources beyond their natural habitat, including:   ex-situ in vitro - cryopreserved material in banks of genetic material, ex situ in vivo - collections of live animals kept away from the place of occurrence.

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), aligning with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. The agricultural sector includes support areas classified as sector 311 according to the OECD methodology (more information at: Aid to the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Rural Development sectors).",

The grant element is calculated specifically for tied aid credits. Additionally, work is underway to include other flows in ODA, e.g. amounts mobilized by the public sector from private sector instruments. Moreover, since 2019, Poland has been reporting a new TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) indicator, which measures the support provided for the implementation of the SDGs at the global level. The presented indicator (2.a.2 Official Development Assistance to the agriculture sector) is a proxy indicator to the one adopted in the official list of indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The replacement of the original indicator (2.a.2 Total official flows (official development assistance plus other official flows) to the agriculture sector) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon.",
