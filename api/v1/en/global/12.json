GDP is the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products less subsidies on products. Resource productivity provides information on whether there is decoupling of economic growth and natural resource use and, by implication, reduction of the negative impact of the economy on the environment. The resource productivity indicator is presented at constant prices as of 2010 (euro/kg) - for comparison of resource productivity in time for a single territorial unit.",

Basic information used to calculate the required and achieved level of recovery, i.e. the mass and number of packaging placed on the market, is determined according to records kept by the entrepreneur. Packaging waste include all packaging, of which multiple use packaging withdrawn from reuse, constituting waste as defined in laws on waste, excluding waste generated in the process of packaging production. Recycling means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations.",

The aim of the Partnership is to integrate representatives of various circles in cooperation for effective achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The initiative increases the awareness of the SDGs, adopted by the international community, their importance for individual social groups and the need to cooperate in their effective implementation. The signatories provide an example of active involvement and responsible implementation of the principles of sustainable development within the organisation, providing a valuable source of inspiration for others. The cooperation of a wide group of stakeholders reflects Poland's efforts to actively involve public and private entities, non-governmental organizations, the science sector and civil society in the planning and implementation of development activities. This is to ensure wider communication, increase awareness of the need for cooperation and dialogue. The signatories join the Partnership during conference events organized by the national coordinator of implementing SDGs in Poland – the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology (until January 2018 – the Ministry of Economic Development). During the ceremony of joining the Partnership, the Signatories on one common Partnership Card, successively sign the following declarations: “Aware of global economic, social and environmental challenges and their complexity, we see sustainable development as an opportunity to create a new economic reality, opening new paths of development for business, based on the principles of transparency and building the image of Poland as a reliable economic partner. We recognise that ambitious goals and targets will be achieved through working together in an effective manner, mobilising forces, creating synergies, a lively and strengthened partnership, the result of dialogue that is open to all stakeholders. In an effort to jointly exploit opportunities for change in the country, region and enterprise, to increase the impact on sustainable development, we express our intention to cooperate within the framework of this partnership initiative for the achievement of the SDGs.”",

Continuing the information and training activities, in 2010, the Public Procurement Office has developed another 'National Action Plan in the field of sustainable procurement for the period 2010-2012', in which - besides promoting environmental aspects in public procurement - it was noted for the first time the need to promote social public procurement, contributing to the reintegration of the representatives of disadvantaged groups (groups with difficult situation in the labour market). This document also specifies the actions the objective of which was to propagate social themes of public procurement. In 2013 the Public Procurement Office has developed another four-year planning document called National Action Plan in the field of sustainable procurement for years 2013-2016, which aims to further promotion of environmental aspects and social tendering in public procurement.",
