Gross value added (GVA) in the gross domestic product account, is the difference between gross output and intermediate consumption. GVA indicates the input of individual producers, industries and sectors to the GDP creation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission per unit of value added is a universal indicator for measuring the impact of industrial production on environment. It captures the intensity of energy use, energy efficiency of production technology and most importantly use of fossil fuels.",
