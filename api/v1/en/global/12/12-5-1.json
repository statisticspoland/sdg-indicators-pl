The obligation of recovery, in particular, recycling, can be implemented by the entrepreneur himself or through a recovery organization, which will take over from the entrepreneur obligations associated with recovery. Basic information used to calculate the required and achieved level of recovery, i.e. the mass and number of packaging placed on the market, is determined according to records kept by the entrepreneur. Packaging waste include all packaging, of which multiple use packaging withdrawn from reuse, constituting waste as defined in laws on waste, excluding waste generated in the process of packaging production. Recycling means any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material but does not include energy recovery and the reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations.",
