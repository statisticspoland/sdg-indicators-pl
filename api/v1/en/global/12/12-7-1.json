Continuing the information and training activities, in 2010, the Public Procurement Office has developed another 'National Action Plan in the field of sustainable procurement for the period 2010-2012', in which - besides promoting environmental aspects in public procurement - it was noted for the first time the need to promote social public procurement, contributing to the reintegration of the representatives of disadvantaged groups (groups with difficult situation in the labour market). This document also specifies the actions the objective of which was to propagate social themes of public procurement. In 2013 the Public Procurement Office has developed another four-year planning document called National Action Plan in the field of sustainable procurement for years 2013-2016, which aims to further promotion of environmental aspects and social tendering in public procurement.",
