EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) The subject of the EU-SILC are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of the European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). StatisticsPoland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: - 1 - for the first adult household member, - 0.5 - for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, - 0.3 - for every child in the household under 14. And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2.1 times as high as that for a 1-person household.",

The severity of food insecurity is measured through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale survey module (FIES-SM), a set of eight questions to the population aged 15 or more about experiences related to lack of access to food. The FIES methodology established by FAO provides a global measurement standard of food insecurity and permits the production of internationally comparable measures of food insecurity severity for individual respondents, as well as comparable national prevalence rates.",

The aim of the programme is to verify the practical application of knowledge acquired in and outside the school. The survey (representative) is carried out in randomly selected schools, and depending on the type of school, it covers randomly selected students aged 15-16 (results are generalized to the entire population). The success of the survey depends on the participation of all sampled schools and students. PISA standards only allow a small-scale denial.PISA tests students skills in three subject areas: reading, mathematics and science . The survey is carried out every three years, since 2000.  Poland has been participating in the study since its inception.PISA tests (developed by an international consortium, with the cooperation of the countries participating in the project) are different from typical school activities, and on the basis of the results, the level of student skills is estimated. The best students reach level 5 or 6 (ability to resolve tasks with a relatively high degree of difficulty), while results below level 2 - a minimum level of competence - indicate very basic skills, which means a higher risk of difficulties coping with education and adult life.PIRLS is the largest international study of reading comprehension in primary schools. The initiator and organizer of the study is the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) - an independent consortium of research organizations and government agencies from almost 70 member countries; in Poland it is coordinated by the Ministry of Education. The study involves students in their fourth year of schooling (due to the reforms in the compulsory school age in Poland, the achievements of third-graders were examined until 2011).The subject of measurement is reading in terms of literary experience (reading literary texts) and reading in order to obtain information (reading informational texts). The study has been carried out since 2001. Poland has been participating in the study since 2006.Based on the results obtained, the skill level of the student is estimated. The best students achieve level 5 (ability to separate important information from irrelevant information, drawing conclusions from premises scattered in the text, etc.), while results below level 2 - the minimum level of competence - indicate that they have only very basic skills (understanding only single sentences).Until 2016, the PIRLS survey in all countries was implemented only in a paper version. Since 2016, it is possible to carry out the survey in two versions: paper and digital. From 2026, the PIRLS survey will be conducted only in a digital version.",

The PIAAC study allows for directly measurement of three competencies: • literacy  • numeracy  • ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. In addition, PIAAC provides information about the relationship between skills and intensity of their use, education, educational activity and labor market situation. International Program of Adult Competencies is coordinated internationally by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and in Poland by the Institute for Educational Research. A representative of the Ministry of National Education represented Poland in a Board of Participating Countries, e.i. in a group that manages the development, implementation and monitoring of the study. In the first round of the PIAAC study (2008-2013) 24 countries were participating, out of which 22 are OECD members. A total of 166 thousand persons aged 16-65 were examined (including 9.4 thousand in Poland). Work on the study concept was undertaken in 2008. In most countries, the study covered the period from August 2011 to March 2012. Publication of results and completion of the first round of PIAAC took place in October 2013. The second round of study (2012-2016) covered 9 further countries and its results were announced in June 2016. Currently, the third round of study (2016-2019) is underway, which will concern the next 6 countries.and its results (international report and datasets) will be published in October 2023. The PIAAC study adopted a contractual scale of competence ranging from 0 to 500 points. This scale has been divided into: • 6 skill levels (1 to 5 and below 1) - in terms of literacy and numeracy • 4 skill levels (1 to 3 and 1 below) - in terms of ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. The higher the level, the better the skill. People with the highest level of understanding of text or mathematical reasoning are assigned 4 or 5 skill levels, and in terms of solving problems in technology-rich environments - level 3. In both cases, people with the weakest results are classified as 1 or less than 1.",

Respondents were selected using the random selection method. Standard interviews conducted within the framework of the study included questions about physical, sexual and psychological violence, including acts of violence on the part of partners (domestic violence). The study also included questions about persistent stalking, sexual harassment, the role of new technologies in abuse-related experiences and violence in childhood.In the FRA study, women were asked to distinguish the events that took place after they were 15 years of age (during a specified period of life) and events from the 12 months preceding the interview.Questions about partner violence related to any violence that occurred during the relationship. The current partners are those who are married or registered as a partner, live together without marriage or are involved in a relationship without living together. Persons who previously remained in one of the above-mentioned forms of the union are considered as former partners. The results referring to the experiences of women with any partner are based on the answers of the respondents who had at least one previous partner in the course of the study.",

The Senate consists of 100 senators. The Sejm and the Senate are elected for four-year terms.  The participation of women / MPs / Senators in the parliament (as of the beginning of the term) in 2011 corresponds to the 7th term of the Sejm and the 8th term of the Senate (from November 8, 2011 to November 11, 2015), in 2015 to the 8th term of the Sejm and the 9th term of the Senate (from November 12, 2015 to November 11, 2019) and in 2019 to the 9th term of the Sejm and the 10th term of the Senate (from November 12, 2019).  The legislative bodies (i.e constituting) of local government units include gmina council, powiat council and voivodship regional council. The gmina council is a constituting and controlling body in the gmina. Since 2018, members of these bodies (councilors) are elected for a five-year term (in the years 1990-2018, the term of office lasted 4 years). Pursuant to the Act of September 29, 2022 on the extension of the term of office of local government units (Journal of Laws of 2022, item 2418), the term of office of the authorities expiring in 2023 was extended once until April 30, 2024.  The executive authority in rural gminas is exercised by a village mayor. The mayor is the executive body of the gmina where the seat of the authorities is located in a city located on the territory of the gmina. In cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, the executive body is the president of the city. This also applies to cities in which, until the entry into force of the Act of 8 March 1990 on Local Self-Government, the president of the city was the executive and managing body.",

The module survey is an additional survey implemented at the same time as the basic survey allowing to extend the scope of information obtained in the basic survey. Since 2017, the observation period of the modular survey 'Unregistered employment in Poland' has covered 12 months of the year (previous editions of the survey covered a period of 9 months, i.e. months from January to September). The extension of the observation period made it possible to assess the scale of the phenomenon throughout the year. Due to the change introduced, the comparability of the time series of data prior to 2017 is limited. In addition, the lack of comparability of the time series for data from 2022 onwards is also affected by methodological changes concerning the definition of the employed person introduced in the basic LFS from Q1 2021. (data on employed persons are used in the denominator when calculating the indicator). Unregistered unemployment is defined as: - employment performed without employment relationship, that is, without a contract, order-agreement, contract for a particular task/work or any other written agreement between the employer and employee, regardless of the ownership sector (also in private households and in private farms) unregistered work cannot be performed on the basis of call, appointment, or election performing unregistered work does not entitle the employee to social security and, by implication, to the right to social benefits the duration of that work is not counted as contribution from the viewpoint of Social Insurance Institution the employer does not allot contribution from the employee's wages and salaries to Social Insurance Institution and Labour Found income taxes are not deducted from income generated through unregistered employment, - self-employment if the concluded economic activity does not meet financial obligations to the state (e.g. taxes).  The employed from 2021 onwards, according to the LFS definition, include all persons aged 15-89 years (previously it was persons aged 15 years and over) who during the survey week: - have been engaged for at least 1 hour in work that generates earnings or income, i.e. have been employed by a public company/institution or private employer, have worked on their own (or leased) farm or have been self-employed outside agriculture, have assisted (without remuneration) in running a family farm or a family business outside agriculture, - had work but did not perform it due to:  • due to illness, or leave of absence, parental leave (maternity, parental, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (working arrangements or receipt of overtime), job-related training, • due to the seasonal nature of the work, if they continued to regularly fulfil work or business-related tasks and duties (excluding legal or administrative duties) during the off-season, • for other reasons, if the expected period of absence from work does not exceed 3 months. In accordance with the international standards, among the employed, there are also included apprentices who entered into occupational training or occupational preparation contract with a private or public employer if they received remuneration.",

Outside the scope of the survey are members of households staying (the total duration of actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as staff hotels, dormitories, boarding schools, nursing homes, etc.) and homeless people. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and ecomically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. The employed are defined as all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week: 1. performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed by a public company/institution or private employer,, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in work on family agricultural farm or in conducting family economic activity outside agriculture, 2. had work but did not perform it due to: • sickness, or rest leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, parental, paternity or childcare), organization of working time (work system or overtime receipt), job-related training, • the seasonal nature of the work, if they continued to regularly fulfill work or business-related tasks and duties (excluding legal or administrative duties) during the off-season, • other reasons, if the expected period of absence from work does not exceed 3 months - did not exceed 3 months. In accordance with the international standards, among the employed, there are also included apprentices who entered into occupational training or occupational preparation contract with a private or public employer if they received remuneration. The employed do not include: volunteers and unpaid interns, people working in individual agriculture engaged in the production of agricultural products exclusively or primarily for their own consumption. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 who simultaneously fulfil three conditions: • within the reference week were not employed, • were actively looking for work, i.e. for over 4 weeks (the reference week being the fourth one) had been involved in concrete actions aimed at finding a job, • were available to take up work within two weeks after the reference week. Persons who were not seeking work because they had already found a job, were only waiting to start work within the period no longer than 3 months, and were available for this job are also included in the category of the unemployed.",

Data for 2021-2022 were compiled according to the new basis of generalisation. Due to the changes introduced, the LFS results are not fully comparable with the survey results for the years prior to 2021. In addition, the lack of comparability of the data time series is also affected by methodological changes introduced to the LFS from Q1 2021. Data for 2010-2020 have been recalculated and presented taking into account the new methodology. These recalculations do not take into account the change in the basis for generalising data to balances based on the Census 2021.",

The randomness in respondent selection was ensured thanks to:  • locality sampling in individual classes,  • address sampling (street and number),  • applying the procedure of random route. Locality and address sampling was carried out via Statistics Poland's central catalogue of streets (ULIC), being part of the system of the address identification of streets, real properties, buildings and dwellings (NOBC) (https://bip.stat.gov.pl/dzialalnosc-statystyki-publicznej/rejestr-teryt/zakres-rejestru-teryt/).",

EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: 1 - for the first adult household member, 0.5 - for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, 0.3 - for every child in the household under 14.",

They can only be used if the evidence gathered indicates a high probability that the defendant committed a crime. Apart from temporary arrest, the remaining preventive measures are non-custodial and include: guarantee, supervision, suspend in official or occupation, ban from leaving the country and stop driving licence. Temporary arrest can only be made by a court order and is a final measure only if another preventive measure is insufficient. Temporary arrest is carried out in remand prisons. Remand prisons may be created as independent remand prisons or as separate prisons. Detention centers are subject to the Minister of Justice.",
