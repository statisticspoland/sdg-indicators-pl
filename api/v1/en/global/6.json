Water supply is a composite of engineering equipment and technical objects, whose task is to provide the population and industry in the water of the required quantities and properties corresponding to its destination. Requirements for the quality of water intended for human consumption, including bacteriological, physico-chemical and organoleptic characteristics determines the regulation of the Minister of Health of 13 November 2015 on the quality of water intended for human consumption (Journal of Laws of 2015, item 1989). Data on urban population connected to water supply and sewage systems comprise the population inhabiting residential buildings connected to a particular network. Due to a change in the estimation method, data from 2014, are not fully comparable with the data presented in previous years. The starting point for data estimation are the results of the National Census of Population and Housing. The data is then corrected by adding information on change of the number of completed buildings and the number of dwellings per one building (based on reports on residential buildings and dwellings in non-residential buildings completed and reports on losses of dwelling stock). The indicator of the number of persons per one dwelling comes from the balance of dwelling stocks. This is the number of actually residing population, as of December 31 in a given year, divided by the number of dwellings. Information on the newly connected or disconnected buildings is derived from the report on water supply system, sewage system and liquid waste stored in septic tanks.",

The types and amount of pollutants in industrial wastewater are very diverse. They depend on the type of industry, type of raw materials used in production and the production technology used. In statistics, the industrial wastewater also include cooling water, polluted and saline waters from mine drainage and sewage works as well as social and living wastewaters related to manufacturing processes.  Data on industrial wastewater refer to sewage discharged by the entities, which according to Polish Classification of Activity were included under 'Industry' covering ”Mining and quarrying”, ”Manufacturing”, ”Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply” and “Water supply sewerage, waste management and remediation activities” as well as other sections, whose share in the volume of discharged sewage is insignificant. Industrial wastewater requiring treatment means sewage discharged via a network of open canals or ditches directly to waters, ground or sewage network from production entities (including water contaminated as a result of dehydration of mines and contaminated waters used in industry for cooling). Municipal wastewater means domestic wastewater or mixture of domestic wastewater with industrial sewage and rainwater disposed of by a commune through sewage water system and wastewater treatment plants.Data on municipal wastewaters cover sewage discharged via a sewage network by the units managed by water supply and sewage companies and plants established by a voivode (or managed by territorial self-local governments) and from 1994 all units supervising collective discharge of sewage via sewage network (including housing cooperatives, water companies, water service plants, enterprises etc.) Prior to discharge to the recipient, all the sewage should be treated. Thus, in the statistics, the wastewater means wastewater requiring treatment. The data do not include precipitation and infiltration water discharged via sewage network. Wastewater treated is wastewater subjected to the process of adjusting to environmental standards or other quality standards. Three methods are distinguished: mechanical, chemical and biological processes or increased biogene removal (including chemical). For the purpose of calculating the total amount of treated wastewater, only the amount which was subjected to the highest mentioned biogene removal is presented. Therefore, wastewater treated mechanically and biologically should be reported as wastewater treated biologically and the wastewater treated using all methods should be reported as treated using increased biogene removal method. Wastewater requiring treatment is wastewater which prior to discharge to the recipient, should undergo treatment processes.",

                            "methodology": "The status of uniform water bodies of river and lakes is evaluated as good or bad by comparing results of the classification of ecological status or potential (on the basis of research results concerning quality indices of waters constituting physico– chemical, biological and hydromorphological elements) with results of the classification of their chemical status if it was planned and completed (on the basis of limit values of chemical quality indices). The worst indicator decides about final assessment. Classification of the uniform water bodies to the moderate or worse ecological status/potential, or to the bad chemical status, shows the bad status of waters, what informs that during evaluated period the uniform water body did not comply the assigned requirements of environmental goals. When the result of assessment showed at least good ecological status/potential, but the chemical status was not assessed or chemical status was good, but it was impossible to classify the ecological status/potential, it was impossible to define the final assessment of the status of uniform water bodies. The assessment of monitored uniform rivers and lakes water bodies was completed with extrapolation or expert assessment of the rest of waters. In the accepted method, when there was no data for precised classification of the ecological status/potential, “at least good” or “below good” classification was assigned, what enabled to define the final assessment of the status. Due to the cyclical planning and programming in water management in Poland, data on the quality of surface waters for: • 2015 refer to the cycle covering the years 2010-2015 for  lakes and rivers (lakes studied in 9 voivodeships, and rivers throughout the country), • 2021 refer to the cycle covering the years 2016-2021 for lakes and rivers (lakes studied in 10 voivodships, and rivers throughout the country).  A significant reduction in the percentage of water bodies with good water quality in 2021 compared to 2015 results from the inclusion of priority substances in water monitoring that were not previously monitored. In addition, in 2016, the regulation on the method of classifying the status of surface water bodies and environmental quality standards for priority substances was amended, in which the requirements for physicochemical elements were tightened.",

It serves as a measure of the efficiency of water use. Total fresh water abstraction includes water removed from any fresh water source, either permanently or temporarily. Mine water and drainage water as well as water abstractions from precipitation are included, whereas water used for hydroelectricity generation (in situ use) is excluded. For the calculation of water productivity Eurostat uses the GDP either in the unit of EUR in chain-linked volumes to the reference year 2010 at 2010 exchange rates or in the unit PPS (Purchasing Power Standard). The unit EUR in chain linked volumes allows observing the water productivity trends over time in a single geographic area, whereas the unit PPS allows to compare countries for the same year.

Until now, it has been ratified by 172 countries which assigned over 2,500 wetlands of international importance, among which are 19 Polish sites. Poland acceded to the convention on 22 march 1978 The convention's mission is the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development accross the world. According to the Ramsar Convention wetlands are '... areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres'. The Ramsar Contracting Parties, including Poland, have committed themselves to designate suitable wetlands for the List of Wetlands of International Importance, work towards the wise use of all their wetlands through national land-use planning, appropriate policies and legislation, management actions, and public education and to cooperate internationally in the implementation of the convention. There are 19 Ramsar Sites on the List of Wetlands of International Importance, in Poland:  Biebrzanski National Park (59,233 ha, since 1995) Slowinski National Park (32,744 ha, since 1995) Wigry National Park (15,085 ha, since 2002) Poleski National Park (9,762 ha, since 2002) Narew River National Park (6,810 ha, since 2002) Milicz Fishponds Nature Reserve (5,298.2 ha, since 1995) Warta River Mouth National Park (7,956 ha, since 1984) Druzno Lake Nature Reserve (3,068 ha, since 2002) Lake of Seven Islands Nature Reserve (1,763.1 ha, since 1984) Luknajno Lake Nature Reserve (1,189 ha, since 1977) Swidwie Lake Nature Reserve (891 ha, since 1984) Karas Lake Nature Reserve (815 ha, since 1984) Subalpine peatbogs in Karkonosze Mountains (40 ha, since 2002) Przemkowskie Ponds Nature Reserve (4,605.4 ha, since 2018) Peatlands of the Izera Valley Nature Reserve (529.4 ha, since 2018) Vistula River Mouth (1,748.1 ha, since 2018) Peatlands in Tatra National Park (741 ha, since 2018) Bór na Czerwonem Nature Reserve (115 ha, since 2018) Post-glacial Ponds of Tatra National Park (571 ha, since 2018) ",

                            "methodology": "Official Development Assistance (ODA) comprises grants and loans that are provided by government agencies or international organizations to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2021” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. The water and sanitation sector includes support areas classified as subsector 31140 and sector 140 according to the OECD methodology (more information at: Aid to the Water and Sanitation sector)",

The grant element is calculated specifically for tied aid credits. Additionally, work is underway to include other flows in ODA, e.g. amounts mobilized by the public sector from private sector instruments. Moreover, since 2019, Poland has been reporting a new TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) indicator, which measures the support provided for the implementation of the SDGs at the global level.",
