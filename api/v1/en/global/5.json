Respondents were selected using the random selection method. Standard interviews conducted within the framework of the study included questions about physical, sexual and psychological violence, including acts of violence on the part of partners (domestic violence). The study also included questions about persistent stalking, sexual harassment, the role of new technologies in abuse-related experiences and violence in childhood.In the FRA study, women were asked to distinguish the events that took place after they were 15 years of age (during a specified period of life) and events from the 12 months preceding the interview.Questions about partner violence related to any violence that occurred during the relationship. The current partners are those who are married or registered as a partner, live together without marriage or are involved in a relationship without living together. Persons who previously remained in one of the above-mentioned forms of the union are considered as former partners. The results referring to the experiences of women with any partner are based on the answers of the respondents who had at least one previous partner in the course of the study.",

A marriage is also concluded when a man and woman entering into a marriage, subject to the internal regulations of a church or other denominational association, in the presence of a priest, at the same time state their will to get married subject to Polish law. The Head of the Public Registry Office will afterwards draw up a marriage certificate.

However, for important reasons, the Court of guardians may authorize the marriage a woman who is over sixteen, and of the circumstances appears that the marriage will be in accordance with the best interests of the established families.",

The Senate consists of 100 senators. The Sejm and the Senate are elected for four-year terms.  The participation of women / MPs / Senators in the parliament (as of the beginning of the term) in 2011 corresponds to the 7th term of the Sejm and the 8th term of the Senate (from November 8, 2011 to November 11, 2015), in 2015 to the 8th term of the Sejm and the 9th term of the Senate (from November 12, 2015 to November 11, 2019) and in 2019 to the 9th term of the Sejm and the 10th term of the Senate (from November 12, 2019).  The legislative bodies (i.e constituting) of local government units include gmina council, powiat council and voivodship regional council. The gmina council is a constituting and controlling body in the gmina. Since 2018, members of these bodies (councilors) are elected for a five-year term (in the years 1990-2018, the term of office lasted 4 years). Pursuant to the Act of September 29, 2022 on the extension of the term of office of local government units (Journal of Laws of 2022, item 2418), the term of office of the authorities expiring in 2023 was extended once until April 30, 2024.  The executive authority in rural gminas is exercised by a village mayor. The mayor is the executive body of the gmina where the seat of the authorities is located in a city located on the territory of the gmina. In cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, the executive body is the president of the city. This also applies to cities in which, until the entry into force of the Act of 8 March 1990 on Local Self-Government, the president of the city was the executive and managing body.",
