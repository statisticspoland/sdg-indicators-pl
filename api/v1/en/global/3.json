Neonatal deaths - deaths of children under 4 weeks of age (0-27 days). 0 day indicates the age of a live born neonate, who did not survive 24 hours. The infant mortality rate is also referred to as neonatal mortality. The following deaths are distinguished: - early neonatal deaths, i.e. occurred within the first 7 days of life (0-6 days) (early infant mortality), - late neonatal deaths, i.e. occurred after the completion of the 7th day of life, but before the completion of 28 days of life. The source of data on death is the document of the Ministry of Health Death certificate, which is basic document for civil status acts and is in the part secondarily utilized by national statistics (Regulation of the Minister of Health, Journal of Laws 2015, item 231). Live birth - the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of an infant, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of the voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta has been separated each such a product is considered as live born. The coefficient is calculated on the basis of death data from the survey Deaths. Mortality. Life Expectancy' and based on live births from the survey 'Birth. Fertility.",

Malignant neoplasm - according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10: disease symbol C00-C97 - it expands in an infiltrative way, ie. it does not push surrounding tissue (as would benign neoplasm), but it penetrates between the cells of normal tissue, giving metastases. Diabetes - according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10: disease entity symbol E10-E14 - a metabolic disease caused by a deficiency or malfunction of insulin, resulting in elevated levels of sugar in the blood - hyperglycemia. Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) - according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10: disease symbol J30-J98 - diseases of the airways and other structures of the lung. Some of the most common are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension.

Family planning: Percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who are married or in-union who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods. 2. Pregnancy and delivery care: Percentage of women aged 15-49 years with a live birth in a given time period who received antenatal care four or more times. 3. Child immunization: Percentage of infants receiving three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccine. 4. Child treatment: Percentage of children under 5 years of age with suspected pneumonia (cough and difficult breathing NOT due to a problem in the chest and a blocked nose) in the two weeks preceding the survey taken to an appropriate health facility or provider.  II. Infectious diseases 5. Tuberculosis: Percentage of incident TB cases that are detected and successfully treated. 6. HIV/AIDS: Percentage of people living with HIV currently receiving antiretroviral therapy. 7. Malaria: Percentage of population in malaria-endemic areas who slept under an insecticide-treated net the previous night [only for countries with high malaria burden]. 8. Water and sanitation: Percentage of households using at least basic sanitation facilities. III. Noncommunicable diseases  9. Hypertension: Age-standardized prevalence of non-raised blood pressure among adults aged 18 years and older, aged-standarized. 10. Diabetes: Age-standardized mean fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) for adults aged 18 years and older. 11. Tobacco: Age-standardized prevalence of adults >=15 years not smoking tobacco in last 30 days.  IV. Service capacity and access 12. Hospital access: Hospital beds per capita, relative to a maximum threshold of 18 per 10,000 population. 13. Health workforce: Health professionals (physicians, psychiatrists, and surgeons) per capita, relative to maximum thresholds for each cadre. 14.

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. The health area includes, among others, areas of support classified to subsector 12182 and sector 122 according to the OECD methodology (more information at: (Aid to Health - OECD).",

They are a set of guidelines, rights and obligations imposed on both the states and the World Health Organization (WHO). International Health Regulations aim at combating and preventing the spread of diseases on an international scale by applying proportionate measures to avoid unnecessary interference with international transport. These regulations regulate the transmission and exchange of information on health hazards between the countries that are party to it and set new standards for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. According to the Article 4 of the International Health Regulations, Poland, as each Member State of the WHO (State Party), designates or establishes the National Focal Point for International Health Regulations. The National Focal Point for International Health Regulations was established at the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene. The Chief Sanitary Inspectorate co-operates with the National Focal Point for International Health Regulations, so that they receive information about events that pose public health threats to the international sign. Since 15th of June 2007, all countries that have ratified the WHO Convention, including Poland, are required to comply with the provisions of the International Health Regulations. The quality and level of the following attributes are taken into account in assessing the implementation of the International Health Regulations:    1. national legislation, policy and financing,   2. coordination and National Focal Point communications,   3. surveillance,   4. response,  5. preparedness,   6. risk communication,   7. human resources,   8. laboratory,   9. points of entry,  10. zoonotic events,   11. food safety,   12. chemical events,   13. radionuclear emergencies.
