Neonatal deaths - deaths of children under 4 weeks of age (0-27 days). 0 day indicates the age of a live born neonate, who did not survive 24 hours. The infant mortality rate is also referred to as neonatal mortality. The following deaths are distinguished: - early neonatal deaths, i.e. occurred within the first 7 days of life (0-6 days) (early infant mortality), - late neonatal deaths, i.e. occurred after the completion of the 7th day of life, but before the completion of 28 days of life. The source of data on death is the document of the Ministry of Health Death certificate, which is basic document for civil status acts and is in the part secondarily utilized by national statistics (Regulation of the Minister of Health, Journal of Laws 2015, item 231). Live birth - the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of an infant, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of the voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta has been separated each such a product is considered as live born. The coefficient is calculated on the basis of death data from the survey Deaths. Mortality. Life Expectancy' and based on live births from the survey 'Birth. Fertility.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2021” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13).  Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.",

Therefore, the indicator did not cover expenditures within multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to the general budgets of organisations, such as WHO, also working in the health area. Since 2018, the leading ODA indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there will be no differentiation into net and gross ODA in that respect. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation."

They are a set of guidelines, rights and obligations imposed on both the states and the World Health Organization (WHO). International Health Regulations aim at combating and preventing the spread of diseases on an international scale by applying proportionate measures to avoid unnecessary interference with international transport. These regulations regulate the transmission and exchange of information on health hazards between the countries that are party to it and set new standards for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. According to the Article 4 of the International Health Regulations, Poland, as each Member State of the WHO (State Party), designates or establishes the National Focal Point for International Health Regulations. The National Focal Point for International Health Regulations was established at the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene. The Chief Sanitary Inspectorate co-operates with the National Focal Point for International Health Regulations, so that they receive information about events that pose public health threats to the international sign. Since 15th of June 2007, all countries that have ratified the WHO Convention, including Poland, are required to comply with the provisions of the International Health Regulations. The quality and level of the following attributes are taken into account in assessing the implementation of the International Health Regulations:    1. national legislation, policy and financing,   2. coordination and National Focal Point communications,   3. surveillance,   4. response,   5. preparedness,   6. risk communication,   7. human resources,   8. laboratory,   9. points of entry,   10. zoonotic events,   11. food safety,   12. chemical events,   13. radionuclear emergencies.
