Preventive measures are used to safeguard the correct course of conduct, and exceptionally also to prevent a new serious crime from being committed by the accused. They can only be used if the evidence gathered indicates a high probability that the defendant committed a crime. Apart from temporary arrest, the remaining preventive measures are non-custodial and include: guarantee, supervision, suspend in official or occupation, ban from leaving the country and stop driving licence. Temporary arrest can only be made by a court order and is a final measure only if another preventive measure is insufficient. Temporary arrest is carried out in remand prisons. Remand prisons may be created as independent remand prisons or as separate prisons. Detention centers are subject to the Minister of Justice.",
