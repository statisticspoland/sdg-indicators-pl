The legal basis for the census was the Act of March 4, 2010 on the national census of population and housing in 2011 (Journal of Laws of March 26, 2010, No. 47, item 277), together with the implementing acts of the Act and Regulation (EC) No 763/2008 of July 9, 2008 on the censuses of population and housing. The census for 2011 included people permanently residing in the territory of Poland irrespective of whether these persons were residing in the country during the census or whether they were abroad and those temporarily residing. The inventory was carried out in buildings, flats, collective accommodation and other non-residential premises. In connection with the Civil Status Act (dated 28th of November 2014), all births in the Republic of Poland are registered with the civil status office component for the place of birth of the child. Death registration is made at the civil status office for the place of death or the place where the corpse were found.",
