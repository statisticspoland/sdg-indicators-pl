The study of the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in households and by individual users started in the European Union (EU) in 2002, using mainly the method of direct or telephone interviews. In Poland, monitoring of the ICT usage in households in accordance with the EU harmonized methodology was launched in 2004. Since then, the survey has been carried out annually and voluntary participation is ongoing. The study is carried out through face-to face interviews and includes households with at least one person aged 16-74 and people of that age. Two separate questionnaires: for households (SSI-10G) and individuals: (SSI-10I) are used in this survey. Mainly qualitative questions (not related to values given in numbers) and closed questions are utilized. Individual questionnaires include questions regarding:  • computer and Internet usage (when lately ?, how often ?, where?)   • Internet usage via mobile devices   • purposes of Internet usage   • making purchases online.",
