The document is an update of the National Development Strategy (SRK 2020). The guiding principle of the Strategy is the balanced development of the whole country in four dimensions:  economic, social, environmental and territorial.  The strategy assumes that all its citizens will benefit from its effects. The document focuses on the knowledge and technology that is being created in Poland, the development and further expansion of Polish companies, the construction of a savings system and the improvement of the quality of institutions and their relations with the public. The importance of inclusion all social groups and all territories in the development processes has also been emphasized. The actions outlined in the Strategy are consistent with the objectives and tasks set out in the UN Agenda 2030. The concept of sustainable and responsible development, which is the basis of the Strategy, is consistent with the UN point of view, i.e. vision of the world free from poverty, where every person has the opportunity to enjoy the development.",
