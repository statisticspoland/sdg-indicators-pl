Road transport of passengers  Road transport of passengers is the total number of passengers carried by scheduled daytime services (according to timetable), special scheduled services (e.g. carriage of employees, to school) and other carriage (e.g. holiday trips) in national and international transport. Data on road transport of passengers do not include transport of persons by buses: of urban public transport enterprises, enterprises carrying out tourist services and transport of persons by buses on own account. The data do not include transport services carried out by entities employing fewer than 9 persons. Air transport of passengers Data concerning air transport of passengers include passengers carried on scheduled flights, additional and rented (chartered), by aircrafts owned by Polish operators in scheduled air transport (transport of passengers on permanent routes and according to permanent flight schedules) as well as other Polish operators providing such services against payment in international and national transport. Maritime transport of goods Cargo transport in cruises finished with merchant ships, own ferries and ships and ferries hired from other ship-owners. It covers cargo transport in all directions, i.e., cargo delivered into Polish ports from foreign ports, from Polish ports into foreign ports, between foreign ports, between Polish ports. It does not cover transport of goods by ships and ferries chartered to foreign ship-owners. Data on the maritime transport fleet concern ships of the Polish property, joint ownership or share, whatever flag they hoist. The ships of the Polish maritime fleet include ships which are owned by Polish maritime transport enterprises, ships rented from a ship-owner company, whose shareholders are Polish enterprises, and ships owned by companies (with a share of Polish capital) with their seat abroad, which are operated by Polish enterprises. Transport by inland waterway fleet  Data concerning transport by inland waterway fleet refer to the fleet operated by Polish inland waterway transport enterprises (including vessels which are at the disposal of foreign enterprises during the period of navigation break on Polish inland waterway) and, since 2001, also entities whose main activity is different than providing these services. The data concerning carriage of goods by inland waterways do not include small consignments carried by passenger vessels. Air transport of goods  Data concerning air transport of goods include freight and passengers carried on scheduled flights, additional and rented (chartered), by aircrafts owned by Polish operators in scheduled air transport (transport of goods on permanent routes and according to permanent flight schedules) as well as other Polish operators providing such services against payment in international and national transport.   Railway transport of goods  Data on railway transport of goods include the sum of the gross weight of all commercial and official consignments (i.e. together with the weight of the packages, and in the case of transport in containers together with the weight of the containers) transported in wagons in national and international transport by all types of trains. The data do not cover shunting.   Road transport of goods  Data concerning road transport of goods refer to total road transport, i.e. both for hire or reward and on own account, in public and private sectors. Road transport for hire or reward is understood as providing paid transport services whereas road transport on own account as carriage of goods on own needs, i.e. without payment (calculated into the costs of a business enterprise). In part, these are estimated data.  Pipeline transport of goods  Data on the pipeline transport of goods include crude oil and crude oil products pumped through major pipelines for the domestic demand (including imported) and by transit through the territory of Poland. The amount of crude oil (crude oil products) is the sum of net weights of individual lots of crude oil (products) received to client's tanks upon delivery-acceptance protocols.

Intramural expenditures on R&amp D include expenditures on R&amp D performed within a statistical unit, whatever the source of funds. They involve both current and capital expenditures linked to R&amp D activities. Current expenditures on R&amp D include personnel costs as well as costs of used materials, non-durable articles and energy, costs of external services (other than R&amp D ) including external processing, transport, renovation, banking, postal, ICT, publishing or municipal services, costs of business trips and other current costs including, in particular, taxes and fees charging costs of activity and profits, property insurance, and equivalents for the benefit of employees – in a part in which they relate to R&amp D . Capital expenditures on R&amp D include expenditures on new fixed assets linked to R&amp D and, since 2016, costs of computer hardware used in reasearch and development activities for more than one year (charges for using the product of intellectual property by another entity as well as expenditures on software developed on one's own), costs of purchased patents, long-term licenses or other non-material and legal values that are used in research and development activities for more than one year. Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is equal to the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products and decreased by subsidies on products. Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",

R&D personnel, apart from conducting R&D activities, may also arrange and manage R&D projects, prepare reports, provide direct ICT, library and documentation maintenance in a given project as well as provide administrative services in the area of finance and human resources. Researchers (i.e. professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects) constitute the most numerous group of R&D personnel.The group ‘pracownicy naukowo-badawczy’ is a Polish equivalent of the researchers group (presented in Frascati Manual), also named as ‘scientists and engineers’. Belonging into this group requires neither formal qualifications nor occupying a specific post. Full-time equivalents (FTE) are conversion units used to determine actual employment in R&D . One full-time equivalent (FTE) means one person-year devoted exclusively to R&D activities. Employment in R&D in full-time equivalents is calculated on the basis of the ratio of working time devoted to R&D by particular employees within a reporting year to full working time on a particulate position in a given institution. Full-time equivalent is the only measure of employment in R&D used in international comparisons and international publications issued by OECD and EUROSTAT.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2016-2020 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on Eastern Partnership countries (Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine) as well as Africa, Asia and Middle East (Ethiopia, Kenya, Lebanon, Mynamar, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Palestine). Polish development cooperation supports strengthening the rule of law, decentralization reforms and combat against corruption as well as human and civil rights compliance. Its main objectives cover the improvement of health care, better access to education and support for entrepreneurship and agriculture as well as natural environment protection including natural disasters prevention. Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.",

Therefore, the indicator did not cover expenditures within multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to the general budgets of international organisations also working in the infrastructure area. Since 2018, the indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there is no differentiation into net and gross ODA. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation."
