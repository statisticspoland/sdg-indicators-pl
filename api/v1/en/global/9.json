Presented work may also contain the results of research being in the development phase. Moreover, this research has been conducted in an innovative way using experimental methods and a new methodological approach. The results of the experimental statistics are not official statistics.The indicator was calculated by Statistical Office in Olsztyn basing on the methodology proposed by the United Nations using data from three databases: two databases maintained by Head Office of Land Surveying and Cartography (GUGiK) (the BDOT10k and PRG databases) as well as the WorldPop database.The Topographic Objects Database (BDOT10k) is a vector database containing the spatial location of topographic features along with a basic description of their properties. The content and detail level of the BDOT10k database generally corresponds to a traditional topographic map at the scale of 1:10,000. Database contains information on road type and category, road surface type, as well as road width and length.The National Register of Boundaries (PRG) is an official reference database providing  the basis for other spatial information systems and using data concerning administrative units of the country. The PRG covers the area of the whole country and contains information about boundaries and areas of the fundamental three-level administrative division of the country (i.e. gminas, powiats, and voivodships), registration units, registration precincts, special borders, as well as addresses and their spatial location.The WorldPop database contains high-resolution global data on the distribution of the human population in the form of a 100x100m raster. The datasets provide an estimate of the number of people living in each grid cell.In order to calculate the index, the following steps were carried out: 1. Exclusion of the city areas and designation of a mask for rural areas analysis based on data from the PRG database. 2. Designation of the roads from the BDOT10k database that meet the 'all-season road' condition, with the exception of city areas. 3. Designation of a road buffer with a radius of 2 kilometres. 4. Calculation of population within the buffer limits based on WorldPop database data and total population for rural areas. 5. Calculation of the indicator.",

Road transport of passengers  Road transport of passengers is the total number of passengers carried by scheduled daytime services (according to timetable), special scheduled services (e.g. carriage of employees, to school) and other carriage (e.g. holiday trips) in national and international transport. Data on road transport of passengers do not include transport of persons by buses: of urban public transport enterprises, enterprises carrying out tourist services and transport of persons by buses on own account. The data do not include transport services carried out by entities employing fewer than 9 persons. Air transport of passengers Data concerning air transport of passengers include passengers carried on scheduled flights, additional and rented (chartered), by aircrafts owned by Polish operators in scheduled air transport (transport of passengers on permanent routes and according to permanent flight schedules) as well as other Polish operators providing such services against payment in international and national transport. Maritime transport of goods Cargo transport in cruises finished with merchant ships, own ferries and ships and ferries hired from other ship-owners. It covers cargo transport in all directions, i.e., cargo delivered into Polish ports from foreign ports, from Polish ports into foreign ports, between foreign ports, between Polish ports. It does not cover transport of goods by ships and ferries chartered to foreign ship-owners. Data on the maritime transport fleet concern ships of the Polish property, joint ownership or share, whatever flag they hoist. The ships of the Polish maritime fleet include ships which are owned by Polish maritime transport enterprises, ships rented from a ship-owner company, whose shareholders are Polish enterprises, and ships owned by companies (with a share of Polish capital) with their seat abroad, which are operated by Polish enterprises. Transport by inland waterway fleet  Data concerning transport by inland waterway fleet refer to the fleet operated by Polish inland waterway transport enterprises (including vessels which are at the disposal of foreign enterprises during the period of navigation break on Polish inland waterway) and, since 2001, also entities whose main activity is different than providing these services. The data concerning carriage of goods by inland waterways do not include small consignments carried by passenger vessels. Air transport of goods  Data concerning air transport of goods include freight and passengers carried on scheduled flights, additional and rented (chartered), by aircrafts owned by Polish operators in scheduled air transport (transport of goods on permanent routes and according to permanent flight schedules) as well as other Polish operators providing such services against payment in international and national transport.   Railway transport of goods  Data on railway transport of goods include the sum of the gross weight of all commercial and official consignments (i.e. together with the weight of the packages, and in the case of transport in containers together with the weight of the containers) transported in wagons in national and international transport by all types of trains. The data do not cover shunting.   Road transport of goods  Data concerning road transport of goods refer to total road transport, i.e. both for hire or reward and on own account, in public and private sectors. Road transport for hire or reward is understood as providing paid transport services whereas road transport on own account as carriage of goods on own needs, i.e. without payment (calculated into the costs of a business enterprise). In part, these are estimated data.  Pipeline transport of goods  Data on the pipeline transport of goods include crude oil and crude oil products pumped through major pipelines for the domestic demand (including imported) and by transit through the territory of Poland. The amount of crude oil (crude oil products) is the sum of net weights of individual lots of crude oil (products) received to client's tanks upon delivery-acceptance protocols.

Intramural expenditures on R&amp D include expenditures on R&amp D performed within a statistical unit, whatever the source of funds. They involve both current and capital expenditures linked to R&amp D activities. Current expenditures on R&amp D include personnel costs as well as costs of used materials, non-durable articles and energy, costs of external services (other than R&amp D ) including external processing, transport, renovation, banking, postal, ICT, publishing or municipal services, costs of business trips and other current costs including, in particular, taxes and fees charging costs of activity and profits, property insurance, and equivalents for the benefit of employees – in a part in which they relate to R&amp D . Capital expenditures on R&amp D include expenditures on new fixed assets linked to R&amp D and, since 2016, costs of computer hardware used in reasearch and development activities for more than one year (charges for using the product of intellectual property by another entity as well as expenditures on software developed on one's own), costs of purchased patents, long-term licenses or other non-material and legal values that are used in research and development activities for more than one year. Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is equal to the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products and decreased by subsidies on products. Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. ODA Sector 2. Economic Infrastructure and Services covers assistance for networks, utilities and services that facilitate economic activity. It includes, but is not exhausted by: Energy: production and distribution of energy, including peaceful use of nuclear energy; Transportation and Communications: essentially equipment or infrastructure for road, rail, water and air transport, and for television, radio and electronic information networks.",
