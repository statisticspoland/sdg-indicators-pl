Neonatal deaths - deaths of children under 4 weeks of age (0-27 days). 0 day indicates the age of a live born neonate, who did not survive 24 hours. The infant mortality rate is also referred to as neonatal mortality. The following deaths are distinguished: - early neonatal deaths, i.e. occurred within the first 7 days of life (0-6 days) (early infant mortality), - late neonatal deaths, i.e. occurred after the completion of the 7th day of life, but before the completion of 28 days of life. The source of data on death is the document of the Ministry of Health Death certificate, which is basic document for civil status acts and is in the part secondarily utilized by national statistics (Regulation of the Minister of Health, Journal of Laws 2015, item 231). Live birth - the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of an infant, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of the voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta has been separated each such a product is considered as live born. The coefficient is calculated on the basis of death data from the survey Deaths. Mortality. Life Expectancy' and based on live births from the survey 'Birth. Fertility.",
