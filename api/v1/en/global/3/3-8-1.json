The indicators are organized by four categories of service coverage:  I. Reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health  1. Family planning: Percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who are married or in-union who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods. 2.

Malaria: Percentage of population in malaria-endemic areas who slept under an insecticide-treated net the previous night [only for countries with high malaria burden]. 8. Water and sanitation: Percentage of households using at least basic sanitation facilities. III. Noncommunicable diseases  9. Hypertension: Age-standardized prevalence of non-raised blood pressure among adults aged 18 years and older, aged-standarized. 10. Diabetes: Age-standardized mean fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) for adults aged 18 years and older. 11. Tobacco: Age-standardized prevalence of adults >=15 years not smoking tobacco in last 30 days.  IV. Service capacity and access 12. Hospital access: Hospital beds per capita, relative to a maximum threshold of 18 per 10,000 population. 13. Health workforce: Health professionals (physicians, psychiatrists, and surgeons) per capita, relative to maximum thresholds for each cadre. 14. Health security: International Health Regulations (IHR) core capacity index, which is the average of attributes of 13 core capacities that have been attained.",
