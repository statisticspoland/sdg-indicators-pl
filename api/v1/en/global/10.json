EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by:  property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office.  For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows:  1 for the first adult household member, 0.5 for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, 0.3 for every child in the household under 14.  And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2,1 times as high as that for a 1-person household. A household is classified into a given quintile groups on the basis of per capita available income in that household. Thus members of all the households in the survey are listed according to the increasing per capita available income using the weights applied in the survey and divided into five groups, equal in number of the weighted persons. The first quintile (I) consists of 20% of persons with the lowest incomes, while the fifth quintile (V) 20% of persons with the highest incomes.",

In a survey carried out in 2015, respondents were asked: 'Would you consider to be a person belonging to a social group that for any reason is treated less favourably (discriminated) than other groups in Poland?' Possible answers were: yes or no. The aim of the social cohesion survey is to gather information allowing a comprehensive assessment of the quality of life (considering economic and social aspects), evaluated from the perspective of both objective and subjective indicators. Owing to the integration of individual data, it is possible to determine i.e. in which groups of the society there is an accumulation of favourable or unfavourable aspects of the quality of life, which factors determine these situations, and which relationships exist between various dimensions of the quality of life. A wide range of collected information enable e.g. to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the level and diversity of lifestyles as well as a multidimensional analysis of poverty, social exclusion, social capital and subjective well-being.",

This set includes the following indicators: 1. Regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (CAR) - the ratio of regulatory capital to the value of risk-weighted assets. The regulatory capital of an institution as defined in accordance with the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (Capital Requirements Regulation-CRR) is the sum of its Tier 1 capital (capital used to cover losses under solvency conditions of a bank this capital allows the bank to continue normal operations and provide liquidity to the bank) and Tier II capital (capital used to cover losses in the condition of loss of solvency of a bank allows the bank to pay off depositors and privileged creditors when the bank ceases to be solvent). Capital requirements expressed in terms of the amount of bank exposure per particular risk, including credit risk. 2. Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets - expressed as percentage a relation of regulatory Tier I capital to the value of risk-weighted assets. The regulatory Tier I capital as defined in in accordance with Capital Requirements Regulation CRR consists of Tier 1 capital and supplementary Tier I capital. Capital requirements expressed in terms of the amount of bank exposure per particular risk, including credit risk. 3. Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital -the ratio of the value of nonperforming loans overdue by more than 90 days to the value of regulatory capital. Nonperforming loans in the case of banks using IAS are classified as impaired loans, and in the case of banks applying PAS - substandard, doubtful and lost. 4. Nonperforming loans to total gross loans - the ratio of the value of nonperforming loans overdue by more than 90 days to the total gross value of credits, including nonimpaired and impaired credits.

                            "methodology": "Official Development Assistance (ODA) comprises grants and loans that are provided by government agencies or international organizations to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2021” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.  Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries. Foreign direct investment is, in another way, capital flows across national borders involving the purchase of an existing enterprise or creation of a new company by a foreign investor, which means that the foreign investor becomes a co-owner or owner of the enterprise operating in the given country.Foreign direct investment is a longterm cooperation, which is a reflection of the lasting interest of the investor. Investments are financial assets, real estates or intangible fixed assets, which are not used by the given unit, but have been acquired in order to achieve economic benefits. They mean the expenses incurred for increasing the stock of productive capital, which unit has. Direct investment reflects long-term investment of an organization owned by a resident of one economy (direct investor) in an organization owned by a resident of other economy (direct investment company) and includes transactions between the two.

Therefore, the indicator did not cover expenditures within multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to the general budgets of international organisations also working in the area of official assistance. Since 2018, the leading ODA indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there is no differentiation into net and gross ODA. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation."
