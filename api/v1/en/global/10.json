EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by:  property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office.  For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows:  1 for the first adult household member, 0.5 for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, 0.3 for every child in the household under 14.  And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2,1 times as high as that for a 1-person household. A household is classified into a given quintile groups on the basis of per capita available income in that household. Thus members of all the households in the survey are listed according to the increasing per capita available income using the weights applied in the survey and divided into five groups, equal in number of the weighted persons. The first quintile (I) consists of 20% of persons with the lowest incomes, while the fifth quintile (V) 20% of persons with the highest incomes.",

The first edition of the BSS was completed by the Central Statistical Office in 2011, the second one in 2015. The survey was attended by nearly 14 thous. respondents aged 16 and more. In a survey carried out in 2015, respondents were asked: 'Would you consider to be a person belonging to a social group that for any reason is treated less favourably (discriminated) than other groups in Poland?' Possible answers were: yes or no. The aim of the social cohesion survey is to gather information allowing a comprehensive assessment of the quality of life (considering economic and social aspects), evaluated from the perspective of both objective and subjective indicators. Owing to the integration of individual data, it is possible to determine i.e. in which groups of the society there is an accumulation of favourable or unfavourable aspects of the quality of life, which factors determine these situations, and which relationships exist between various dimensions of the quality of life. A wide range of collected information enable e.g. to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the level and diversity of lifestyles as well as a multidimensional analysis of poverty, social exclusion, social capital and subjective well-being.",

Wages and salaries concern amounts booked in activity costs for a given period and, therefore, do not include payments from profit and balance surplus in cooperatives. Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is equal to the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products and decreased by subsidies on products. Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",

This set includes the following indicators: 1. Regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (CAR) - the ratio of regulatory capital to the value of risk-weighted assets. The regulatory capital of an institution as defined in accordance with the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (Capital Requirements Regulation-CRR) is the sum of its Tier 1 capital (capital used to cover losses under solvency conditions of a bank this capital allows the bank to continue normal operations and provide liquidity to the bank) and Tier II capital (capital used to cover losses in the condition of loss of solvency of a bank allows the bank to pay off depositors and privileged creditors when the bank ceases to be solvent). Capital requirements expressed in terms of the amount of bank exposure per particular risk, including credit risk. 2. Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets - expressed as percentage a relation of regulatory Tier I capital to the value of risk-weighted assets. The regulatory Tier I capital as defined in in accordance with Capital Requirements Regulation CRR consists of Tier 1 capital and supplementary Tier I capital. Capital requirements expressed in terms of the amount of bank exposure per particular risk, including credit risk. 3. Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital -the ratio of the value of nonperforming loans overdue by more than 90 days to the value of regulatory capital. Nonperforming loans in the case of banks using IAS are classified as impaired loans, and in the case of banks applying PAS - substandard, doubtful and lost. 4. Nonperforming loans to total gross loans - the ratio of the value of nonperforming loans overdue by more than 90 days to the total gross value of credits, including nonimpaired and impaired credits. Gross credits are not reduced by the value of write-offs/reserves.5. Sectoral distribution of loans to total loans: residents - the ratio of value of gross loans granted to individual sectors of the economy to total gross loans Total gross loans include both impaired and nonimpaired loans, and they are not reduced by the value of write-offs/reserves. 6. Return on assets (ROA) - expressed in percentage a relation of the net financial result in the period of 12 months preceding the balance sheet date to the average asset size in that period. 7. Return on equity (ROE) - the ratio of the net financial result in the period of 12 months preceding the balance sheet date to average amount of Tier 1 regulatory capital in that period. 8. Interest margin / Net interest income to gross income - the ratio of value of the difference between interest income earned by the bank and interest expenses paid by the bank to the gross income (which is the sum of net interest income from fees and commisions, result of valuation trading activity, income from dividends and other operating income) in the period of 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. 9. Noninterest expenses to gross income - the ratio of all cost items of banks except for interest expenses to gross income in the period of 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. 10. Liquid assets to total assets (liquid asset ratio) - the ratio of the value of assets, which may be, without excessive loss, converted into cash to total assets. Liquid assets according to the broad measure defined in the IMF handbook include: cash in hand, operations with central bank (current account nostro, one-day deposits), current accounts - financial sector (banks), debt securities held for trading (central banks, central government institutions) debt instruments for sale (central banks, central government institutions) and debt instruments measured at fair value with the result of valuation related to the profit or loss account (central banks, central government institutions).Assets - material resources controlled by an entity of credibly specified value, obtained as aresult of past events and which will bring economic benefits to the entity. There are financial assets (including but not limited to cash, credits, securities) and nonfinancial ((including but not limited to fixed assets). 11. Liquid assets to short-term liabilities - the value of liquid assets in relation to total liabilities with maturity up to 1 year from the balance sheet date. 12. Net open position in foreign exchange to capital.- the ration of the value of net open foreign currency position to regulatory Tier I capital. Open foreign currency position (net) is a difference of long and short position in foreign currencies resulting form possessed financial instruments (assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items). Long position means profit form foreign currency appreciation and loss from foreign currency depreciation (short position - vice versa). Capital requirements, total regulatory capital and regulatory Tier 1 capital have been used to calculate indicators since the first quarter of 2014. Determined in accordance with the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation-CRR). In the period from March 2010 to December 2013 the data in terms of capital adequacy, including own funds, were established by banks in accordance with the provisions of Article 127 of Banking Law, Resolution of Financing Supervision Committee No. 76/2010 and No. 381/2008. Polish Accounting Standards (PAS) - national accounting rules laid down in the Act of 29 September 1994 on accounting (uniform text from 2013. Item 330, as amended) and the implementing legislation to the law and the accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards Committee.International Accounting Standards (IAS) - International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and related interpretations published in the form of regulations of the European Commission. In accordance with the methodology for compilation financial soundness indicators (FSI) amended by the International Monetary Fund, from 2021 onwards, the indicator 'Sector concentration of loans to total loans to residents' has been replaced by the indicator 'Loan concentration by economic activity', defined as “The lending to the largest three economic activities, as a proportion of their total gross loans to nonfinancial corporations”.",

                            "methodology": "Official Development Assistance (ODA) comprises grants and loans that are provided by government agencies or international organizations to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. Foreign direct investment is, in another way, capital flows across national borders involving the purchase of an existing enterprise or creation of a new company by a foreign investor, which means that the foreign investor becomes a co-owner or owner of the enterprise operating in the given country.Foreign direct investment is a longterm cooperation, which is a reflection of the lasting interest of the investor. Investments are financial assets, real estates or intangible fixed assets, which are not used by the given unit, but have been acquired in order to achieve economic benefits. They mean the expenses incurred for increasing the stock of productive capital, which unit has. Direct investment reflects long-term investment of an organization owned by a resident of one economy (direct investor) in an organization owned by a resident of other economy (direct investment company) and includes transactions between the two. (+) signifies Polish capital outflows abroad(-) signifies the withdrawal of Polish capital from abroad",
