Gross domestic product (GDP) illustrates the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy (resident producer units - domestic) in a given year. The exact definition and methodology for calculating GDP is contained in the regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010). GDP value can be calculated in three ways:  • from the production side GDP is the sum of value added of all institutional sectors or all sections of the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) of domestic production entities plus taxes less subsidies on products,  • from the distribution side GDP is calculated as the sum of domestic demand, i.e. final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation as well as external balance of goods and services,  • as the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes less subsidies on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy).",

The exact definition and methodology for calculating GDP is contained in the regulation of the Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 549/2013 of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010).   Current prices are prices actually used in purchase-sell transactions of goods and services in a given period.   Constant prices result from average current prices in a given year. They allow for a more accurate observation of a given phenomenon through the elimination of the influence of current prices changes.   Gross fixed capital formation is the expenditure which increases the value of tangible fixed assets (buildings and structures, machinery, technical equipment and tools, transport equipment and other fixed assets), excluding expenditure comprising the initial investments as well as interest on investment credits and loans for the period of investment realization. GFC also includes expenditure on:  a) intellectual property products, intended for use for a period longer than 1 year - in particular expenditure on research and development and on computer software (purchased or produced for own final use)  b) small tools that are used in the production longer than 1 year - regardless of their value  c) weapons systems (e.g., tanks, armored vehicles, warships, submarines).    Indices of prices of consumer goods and services are calculated on the basis of observations of prices of selected representative items of consumer goods and services in specific regions of the price survey in Poland. The survey is based on the purposive sampling of representative items. A centrally fixed list of representative items of goods and services remains unchanged and obligatory for all regions covered by the price survey throughout a year.   General government debt and result are calculated in compliance with the European Union methodology ESA 2010 (European System of National and Regional Accounts), implemented by the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 549/2013 of 21 May 2013. ESA 2010 in scope of definitions, principles, entries and classifications is generally coherent with the international system of national accounts - 2008 SNA (System of National Accounts of United Nations). Differences between ESA and SNA (mostly in the way of account's presentation) arise from the specificity of the national accounts system in the European Union, which requires greater precision in definitions and in accounting rules.   General government sector - according to the ESA2010 - includes the following entities of the national economy:  a) entities operating according to principles described in Law on Public finances (budgetary units, appropriated funds and since 2010 also local budgetary establishments, executive agencies and budget institutions as well as until 2005 special funds of budgetary entities, in 2005-2010 - own income account of budgetary entities and until 2010 - budgetary establishments and auxiliary units of budgetary entities including conducting economic activity ones as well as motivation funds), b) entities for which the financial system was defined in special regulations, and for which the subsidies from the state budget are the main source of financing (public higher education institutions, the Polish Academy of Science and entities established by it, the National Road Fund and other funds managed by Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, agriculture advisory units and state agencies), c) independent public self-government health care facilities, d) state and local government institutions of culture and national film institutions, e) funds with the legal personality which are connected with state or local government units budgets, f) institutions managing the social security funds (SII, ASIF) and these funds as well as the National Health Fund (in the period 1 I 1999&mdash;31 III 2003 &mdash; health funds), g) public hospitals in the form of limited liability companies and hospitals acting as research institutes (excluded from non-financial corporations sector), h) Bank Guarantee Fund (excluded from financial corporations sector), i) other units, including public corporations and non-commercial institutions that meet ESA 2010 classification criteria to general government sector.

The guiding principle of the Strategy is the balanced development of the whole country in four dimensions:  economic, social, environmental and territorial.  The strategy assumes that all its citizens will benefit from its effects. The document focuses on the knowledge and technology that is being created in Poland, the development and further expansion of Polish companies, the construction of a savings system and the improvement of the quality of institutions and their relations with the public. The importance of inclusion all social groups and all territories in the development processes has also been emphasized. The actions outlined in the Strategy are consistent with the objectives and tasks set out in the UN Agenda 2030. The concept of sustainable and responsible development, which is the basis of the Strategy, is consistent with the UN point of view, i.e. vision of the world free from poverty, where every person has the opportunity to enjoy the development.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies.",

                            "methodology": "Official Development Assistance (ODA) comprises grants and loans that are provided by government agencies or international organizations to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) - the countries with the lowest levels of socio-economic development, which meet the following three criteria: average income per capita below $ 1018 for 3 years, low human resources (malnutrition, high mortality, low level of education) and the sensitivity of the economy (dependence on the production of raw materials or agricultural products). The list of LDCs covers about 50 countries (most of them are African countries). Gross National Income (GNI) - the gross primary income of all property sectors or all national institutional sectors it is the sum of gross domestic product and income from abroad.

                            "methodology": "Official Development Assistance (ODA) comprises grants and loans that are provided by government agencies or international organizations to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) - the countries with the lowest levels of socio-economic development, which meet the following three criteria: average income per capita below $ 1018 for 3 years, low human resources (malnutrition, high mortality, low level of education) and the sensitivity of the economy (dependence on the production of raw materials or agricultural products). The list of LDCs covers about 50 countries (most of them are African countries). Gross National Income (GNI) - the gross primary income of all property sectors or all national institutional sectors it is the sum of gross domestic product and income from abroad.    The State Budget constitutes a part of budgetary act and determines: 1. the total amount of projected tax revenues and non-tax revenues of state budget  2. the total amount of planned budget expenditure  3. the amount of the planned state budget deficit together with the sources of its coverage  4. the total amount of projected revenues of the European Funds Budget  5. total amount of planned budget expenditures of the European Funds Budget  6. the financial result of the European Funds Budget  7. the total amount of planned income of the state budget  8. the total amount of planned expenditures of the state budget  9. the planned balance of revenues and expenditures of the state budget  10. limit for liabilities incurred on loans and securities issued.",

The grant element is calculated specifically for tied aid credits. Additionally, work is underway to include other flows in ODA, e.g. amounts mobilized by the public sector from private sector instruments. Moreover, since 2019, Poland has been reporting a new TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) indicator, which measures the support provided for the implementation of the SDGs at the global level.",

GDP value can be calculated in three ways:  • from the production side GDP is the sum of value added of all institutional sectors or all sections of the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) of domestic production entities plus taxes less subsidies on products,  • from the distribution side GDP is calculated as the sum of domestic demand, i.e. final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation as well as external balance of goods and services,  • as the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes less subsidies on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy).  Personal remittances comprise personal transfers and compensation of employees. Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by non-resident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees. The methodology used is in line with the Sixth Edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6).",

Pursuant to the Public Finance Act, public debt includes following liabilities: - securities issued for cash claims (other than equity securities) - loans and borrowings taken, - deposits taken, - matured liabilities (i.e. liabilities which payment term expired but are not yet barrred or decommitted), - resulting from separate laws and legally binding court decisions or final administrative decisions, - recognized as uncontested by the relevant public finance sector entity that is the debtor. One of the components of public debt is the State Treasury debt (two other components are local government debt and social security debt). Treasury debt is the government's commitment to cover, amon others, the budget deficit. State Treasury debt typically accounts for about 90% of public debt. The cost of debt service is the state budget expenditure. The costs of debt service includes primarily interest and discount on treasury securities, interest and fees on loans and borrowings received, costs of issuing treasury securities and payments under sureties and guarantees granted by the Treasury. Exports include the value of goods leaving the country within the framework of trade transactions as well as the value of services, among others, transport, construction and communications, net processing turnover, printing services, financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM). The value of exports includes estimated balance of purchases made by Polish citizens abroad as well as purchases made by foreigners in Poland.",

The first in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) usage research conducted by all national statistical offices (by Central Statistical Office in Poland) and the second in telecommunication market research conducted by national regulators of the telecommunications market (respectively by the Electronic Communications Office). The EU statistics on the telecommunications market used by the Office of Electronic Communications and the European Commission for fixed-line broadband are considered those with speeds above 144 kbps. On the other hand, for research conducted by national statistical offices, coordinated by Eurostat, broadband is defined by the type of technique used for the connection, not its speed. These include DSL technologies such as ADSL, HDSL, SDSL, VDSL, Ethernet LANs, which are the backbone of broadband connections, and others with high bandwidth (wired or wireless). Data for the indicator comes from a survey conducted twice a year by the Office of Electronic Communications for the European Commission (Digital Agenda). The survey covers about 100-120 largest telecommunications undertakings with a combined market share of over 95%. The indicator is presented according to the connection speed for the following speed ranges:  • less than 30 Mbps  • from 30 Mbps to less than 100 Mbps  • from 100 Mbps It presents the number of fixed line and wireless broadband internet subscribers per 100 persons (according to the population at the end of the year announced by the Statistics Poland). Data on population were compiled on the basis of:  • the balances of the residing population in a gmina based on the results of 2011 Population and Housing Census (for data since 2010) for previous years (2003 - 2009) on the basis of the 2002 Population and Housing Census,  • the registers of the Ministry of Interior - internal and international migration of population for permanent residence (since 2006 the presented data come from the Common Electronic System of Population Register - PESEL),  • documentation of Civil Status Offices regarding registered marriages, births and deaths.",

The study of the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in households and by individual users started in the European Union (EU) in 2002, using mainly the method of direct or telephone interviews. In Poland, monitoring of the ICT usage in households in accordance with the EU harmonized methodology was launched in 2004. Since then, the survey has been carried out annually and voluntary participation is ongoing. The study is carried out through face-to face interviews and includes households with at least one person aged 16-74 and people of that age. Two separate questionnaires: for households (SSI-10G) and individuals: (SSI-10I) are used in this survey. Mainly qualitative questions (not related to values given in numbers) and closed questions are utilized. Individual questionnaires include questions regarding:  • computer and Internet usage (when lately ?, how often ?, where?)   • Internet usage via mobile devices   • purposes of Internet usage   • making purchases online.",

ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies.",

The grant element is calculated specifically for tied aid credits. Additionally, work is underway to include other flows in ODA, e.g. amounts mobilized by the public sector from private sector instruments. Moreover, since 2019, Poland has been reporting a new TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) indicator, which measures the support provided for the implementation of the SDGs at the global level.",
