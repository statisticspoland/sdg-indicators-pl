The severity of food insecurity is measured through the application of the Food Insecurity Experience Scale survey module (FIES-SM), a set of eight questions to the population aged 15 or more about experiences related to lack of access to food. The FIES methodology established by FAO provides a global measurement standard of food insecurity and permits the production of internationally comparable measures of food insecurity severity for individual respondents, as well as comparable national prevalence rates.",
