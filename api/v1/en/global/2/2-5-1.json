                        "methodology": "The collections of plants maintained in the gene bank include: agricultural crops (cereals, root crops, special, herbage plants, fodder crops, energy and reclamation crops, small leguminous plants, marginal legumes), vegetable and orchard plants (including root stocks of seed trees, root stocks of stone trees, berry plants), honey and decorative plants. The plant genetic resources are calculated on the basis of the database containing the number of objects and associated data. Information is available at: http://egiset.ihar.edu.pl/index.aspx?lang=en-GB of IHAR-PIB. The database includes resources stored in the gene bank collections, in various forms, located at IHAR Radzików (central seed storage) and in a number of other institutions, including the Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice, the Arboretum and the Department of Physiography in Bolestraszyce&nbsp; Polish Academy of Sciences Botanical Garden &ndash; Center for Biological Diversity Conservation in Powsin&nbsp; Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW&nbsp; Poznan University of Life Sciences&nbsp; Society of Friends of the Lower Vistula River in Gruczno&nbsp; Plant Breeding of Poznań LLC in Tulce&nbsp; Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants in Poznań&nbsp; Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation - NRI in Puławy. The number of &nbsp;livestock genetic resources is calculated on the basis of ex situ in vitro and ex situ in vivo methods. There are the following methods to protect the animal population from extinction:  in situ - the protection of living animals in their natural environment, ex-situ-protection of genetic resources beyond their natural habitat, including:   ex-situ in vitro - cryopreserved material in banks of genetic material, ex situ in vivo - collections of live animals kept away from the place of occurrence  In the case of ex situ in vivo collections, in order for them to be considered long-term and stable, it is assumed that they are in public sector institutions.",
