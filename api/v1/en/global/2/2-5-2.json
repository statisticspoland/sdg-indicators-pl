The Genetic Resources Protection Program in Poland covers the following breeds of animals:  4 breeds of cattle, 3 breeds of pigs, 7 breeds of horses, 15 breeds of sheep, 14 geese breeds, 11 breeds of laying hens, 10 ducks breeds, 4 breeds of fur animals 5 lines of bees.  There are the following methods to protect the animal population from extinction:  in situ - the protection of living animals in their natural environment, ex-situ-protection of genetic resources beyond their natural habitat, including:   ex-situ in vitro - cryopreserved material in banks of genetic material, ex situ in vivo - collections of live animals kept away from the place of occurrence.
