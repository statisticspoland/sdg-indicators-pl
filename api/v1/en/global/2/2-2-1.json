If the median height is 120 cm, it means that the height in a half of the population is lower than 120 cm, and in the second half the height is over 120 cm. Standard Deviation - indicates how much the value of a given variable is dispersed around the average, which is median (growth to age) in the indicator in question. The lower the deviation value, the more observations are focused around the average. The indicator is calculated on the basis of information obtained from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS). This study covers persons aged 15 and more in households living in the territory of the country. In Poland the survey covered also children at age 0-14 years.",
