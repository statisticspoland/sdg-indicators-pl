A marriage is concluded when a man and woman, both present at the same time, make a declaration of marriage before the Head of a Public Registry Office. A marriage is also concluded when a man and woman entering into a marriage, subject to the internal regulations of a church or other denominational association, in the presence of a priest, at the same time state their will to get married subject to Polish law. The Head of the Public Registry Office will afterwards draw up a marriage certificate. According to art. 10 1 of the Family and Guardianship Code, marriage cannot be concluded by a person who has not reached 18 years of age. However, for important reasons, the Court of guardians may authorize the marriage a woman who is over sixteen, and of the circumstances appears that the marriage will be in accordance with the best interests of the established families.",

The replacement of the original indicator (5.3.1 Proportion of women aged 20–24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon.",
