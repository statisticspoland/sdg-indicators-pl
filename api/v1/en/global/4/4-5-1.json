Parity index is a ratio of one quantity to the other (within a given index). The quantity referring to the group in a less privileged situation is usually captured in the numerator of a fraction. When the index equals 1, there is equality between the groups. The more the index value differs from 1, the bigger the disproportion between the groups.  Gender parity index is a ratio of given index values for women and men.   The gender parity indices in education are calculated on the basis of the following indicators:  4.1.1.b Percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in reading   for gender parity index in reading at the end of lower-secondary school, 4.1.1.c Percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in mathematics - for gender parity index in mathematics at the end of lower-secondary school, 4.2.2 Participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age) - for gender parity index in pre-primary education for 6-year-old children.
