A new instrument of international law, implementing the third objective of the Convention on Biological Diversity (on the right of countries to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies) is The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. It was adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention at its tenth meeting in 2010. After the entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol, which occurred on 12 October 2014, all entities that obtain their genetic resources originating from countries that have ratified the Protocol, are obliged to respect the provisions of the Protocol and instruments implementing it. Poland signed the Nagoya Protocol on 20 September 2011 and is currently in the process of its ratification. The Nagoya Protocol applies to access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use. Aims to establish a system requiring users of genetic resources to share with donor resources benefits arising as a result of their use. The Nagoya Protocol applies both to genetic resources of organisms occurring in the wild, and used in the economy (with the exception of human genetic resources). Affect the functioning of the donors and recipients of genetic resources, including among others: botanical and zoological gardens, gene banks, the agricultural sector (animal husbandry, cultivation of plants, seed production, feed production), horticulture, forestry, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, biotechnology, food processing, and even industries with the production of fuels and plastics. In the European Union obligations of the users of genetic resources in all the Member States is governed by a Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on compliance measures for users from the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization in the Union. The task and the jurisdiction of the public authorities in the exercise of the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 511/2014, the rules and general principle concerning mechanism for control of obtaining, possession and utilization of genetic resources and the principle of liability for infringement of the provisions - in Poland is governed by the Law of 19 July 2016, on access to genetic resources and sharing of benefits arising from their utilization (Journal of Laws 2016, item 1340).",

Trade means export, re-export, import and introduction from the sea, whereas re-export means export of any specimen that has previously been imported. Appendix I lists species that are the most endangered or which are or may be subject to commercial activity.Trade in these species should be under particular supervision in order to present further threat to their existence and may be permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Appendix II lists:  • all species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so, unless trade is closely controlled to prevent exploitation which cannot be reconciled with their preservation and  • some specimen, which should be subject to supervision for the purpose of efficient control of trade in species enlisted in Appendix II. Appendix III is a list of species included at the request of a Party that already regulates trade in the species and that needs the cooperation of other countries to prevent unsustainable or illegal exploitation. Total number of CITES speciments for 2010-2015 specifies the number of alive plants and animals. In addition:  • for year 2010: in total - 8286 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 70 specimens (70 kg) of frozen European eel.  • for year 2011: in total - 2m3 Swietnia spp. wood and 3000 seeds of cactus Astrophytum asterias as well as 9594 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM).  • for year 2012: in total - 8217 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 7 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2013: in total - 2137 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 2 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2014: in total - 2040 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 1 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2015: in total - 9986 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 7 specimens of ivory.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies.",

Pursuant to the convention: species means any species, subspecies, or geographically separate population thereof whereas specimen means:  • any animal or plant, either alive or dead  • in the case of an animal:for species included in Appendices I and II, any readily recognizable part or derivative thereof and for species included in Appendix III, any readily recognizable part or derivative thereof specified in Appendix III in relation to the species  • in the case of a plant: for species included in Appendix I, any readily recognizable part or derivative thereof and for species included in Appendices II and III, any readily recognizable part or derivative thereof specified in Appendices II and III in relation to the species. Trade means export, re-export, import and introduction from the sea, whereas re-export means export of any specimen that has previously been imported. Appendix I lists species that are the most endangered or which are or may be subject to commercial activity.Trade in these species should be under particular supervision in order to present further threat to their existence and may be permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Appendix II lists:  • all species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so, unless trade is closely controlled to prevent exploitation which cannot be reconciled with their preservation and  • some specimen, which should be subject to supervision for the purpose of efficient control of trade in species enlisted in Appendix II. Appendix III is a list of species included at the request of a Party that already regulates trade in the species and that needs the cooperation of other countries to prevent unsustainable or illegal exploitation. Total number of CITES speciments for 2010-2015 specifies the number of alive plants and animals. In addition:  • for year 2010: in total - 8286 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 70 specimens (70 kg) of frozen European eel.  • for year 2011: in total - 2m3 Swietnia spp. wood and 3000 seeds of cactus Astrophytum asterias as well as 9594 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM).  • for year 2012: in total - 8217 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 7 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2013: in total - 2137 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 2 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2014: in total - 2040 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 1 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2015: in total - 9986 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 7 specimens of ivory.",
