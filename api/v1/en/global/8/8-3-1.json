A module survey is an additional survey carried out simultaneously with the core survey, which allows extending the scope of information obtained in the core survey. Unregistered unemployment is defined as:  – employment performed without employment relationship, that is, without a contract, order-agreement, contract for a particular task/work or any other written agreement between the employer and employee, regardless of the ownership sector (also in private households and in private farms) unregistered work cannot be performed on the basis of call, appointment, or election  performing unregistered work does not entitle the employee to social security and, by implication, to the right to social benefits  the duration of that work is not counted as contribution from the viewpoint of Social Insurance Institution  the employer does not allot contribution from the employee's wages and salaries to Social Insurance Institution and Labour Found  income taxes are not deducted from income generated through unregistered employment,  – self-employment if the concluded economic activity does not meet financial obligations to the state (e.g. taxes). The employed are defined as all persons aged 15 and more who during the reference week:  – performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in work on family agricultural farm or in conducting family economic activity outside agriculture,  – had work but did not perform it due to:  ​ sickness, maternity leave, paternal leave or vacation,  ​ other reasons but the break in employment:  - did not exceed 3 months,  - excedeed 3 months but these persons worked as employees and during that period received at least 50% of the hitherto remuneration. In accordance with the international standards, among the employed, there are also included apprentices who entered into occupational training or occupational preparation contract with a private or public employer if they received remuneration.",

The replacement of the original indicator (8.3.1 Proportion of informal employment in total employment, by sector and sex) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon."
