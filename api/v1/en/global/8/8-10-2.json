The way that country-wide sample was selected ensured representativeness of the survey results for Poland's population aged 15+ with respect to sex, age and place of residence (locality LAU-1, LAU-2 and voivodship NUTS-2 size). The randomness in respondent selection was ensured thanks to:  • locality sampling in individual classes,  • address sampling (street and number),  • applying the procedure of random route. Locality and address sampling was carried out via Statistics Poland's central catalogue of streets (ULIC), being part of the system of the address identification of streets, real properties, buildings and dwellings (NOBC) (https://bip.stat.gov.pl/dzialalnosc-statystyki-publicznej/rejestr-teryt/zakres-rejestru-teryt/).",
