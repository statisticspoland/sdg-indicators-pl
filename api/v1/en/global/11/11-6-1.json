The replacement of the original indicator (11.6.1 Proportion of municipal solid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out of total municipal waste generated, by cities) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon. Estimated data on the management of municipal waste up to 2022. Since 2023, the data are not comparable with previous years due to a change in the calculation method.",
