R&D includes: scientific research (basic, applied, industrial) and experimental development. Intramural expenditures on R&D are expenditures incurred in a reporting year on R&D in the reported entity, irrespective of origin of such funds, i.e. including funds obtained from abroad (exports of R&D). They cover both current expenditures and investment outlays on fixed assets related to R&;D, but do not cover depreciation of these assets. Intramural expenditures on R&D are examined according to the fields of science divided into: natural, engineering and technology, medical and health, agricultural, social as well as humanities sciences. Expenditures on R&D by fields of science are converted according to the percentage share of total expenditures. According to Frascati Manual, agricultural science is a field of science that covers the following fields: agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, animal and dairy science, veterinary science, agricultural biotechnology as well as other agricultural sciences. Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy in a given year. GDP value can be calculated in three ways: - from the production side GDP is the sum of value added of all institutional sectors or all sections of the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) of domestic production entities plus taxes less subsidies on products, - from the distribution side GDP is calculated as the sum of domestic demand, i.e. final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation as well as external balance of goods and services, - as the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation ofemployees, taxes less subsidies on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixedincome of the total economy). Gross domestic product is calculated according to the principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010), whicha are obligatory in the European Union countries, and recommendations of the Eurostat.",

The household budget survey is conducted using representative method based on random sample which allows generalisation, within a margin of an error, of the results for all households in the country. The monthly rotation of households implemented since 1993 assumes that every month of the year a different group of households participates in the survey. The survey covers one-person and multi-person households. Households of foreign citizens with permanent or long-lasting residence in Poland and using Polish language also take part in the survey. The purpose of the survey is to enable the analysis of the living standards of the population as well as evaluate the impact of various factors on the living standard and its diversity among basic groups of households.  Household budget survey  provides detailed information on:  ∙ the level and the structure of expenditures, sources of acquiring goods and services;  ∙ the consumption level of basic food products according to quantity, but also energetic value and nutrients;  ∙ prices at which households purchase selected goods and services;  ∙ the level and sources of their incomes;  ∙ household equipment with durables;  ∙ dwelling conditions;  ∙ subjective evaluation of the material condition of households;  ∙ demographic and social structure of the households i.e. on the number, age, gender, education, disability and economic activity of the members of the surveyed household.  The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Disposable income is designated for consumer goods and services expenditures and for savings increase. Disposable income is available income less other expenditures. Available income is designated for expenditure and savings increase. It is a sum of household's current incomes from various sources reduced by prepayments on personal income tax, by tax on income from property, taxes paid by self-employed persons ( including those in free professions and individual farmers) and by social security and health insurance premiums. The available income covers both income in cash and in kind, including natural consumption (consumer goods and services taken to satisfy household's needs from self-employment - in and outside farming) as well as goods and services received free of charge. Available income consists of:  income from hired work, income from private farm in agriculture, income from self-employment other than in private farm in agriculture and income from practising free profession, income from property, income from rental of a property, social insurance benefits, other benefits, other incomes (including gifts and alimonies).    Expenditures on consumer goods and services  are allocated to satisfying household's needs. They include products purchased by cash, also using debt or credit card, on credit, received free of charge and natural consumption (consumer goods and services taken from individual farm or own economic activity to satisfy household's needs). Consumer goods comprise non-durable goods (e.g. food, beverages or medicines), semi-durable goods (e.g. clothes, books, toys) and durable goods (e.g. cars, washing machines, refrigerators, television sets).   Other expenditures  include:  ∙ gifts donated to other households and non-commercial institutions;  ∙ certain taxes, such as tax on legacy and donations, tax on real estates, fees for perpetual use of the land;   ∙ prepayments of personal income tax and social security contributions paid directly by the tax payer;  ∙ other kinds of expenditures not allocated directly to consumption, including sums lost in gambling and lotteries, losses of cash and bails.",

A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese. Body mass index (BMI) is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres (kg/m2). For adults over 20 years old, BMI falls into one of the following categories:   18.5 - 24.9 - normal weight, 25.0 - 29.9 - pre-obesity, 30.0 - 34.9 - obesity class I, 35.0 - 39.9 - obesity class II, >=40 - obesity class III.  The BMI ranges are based on the effect excessive body fat has on disease and death and are reasonably well related to adiposity. BMI was developed as a risk indicator of disease; as BMI increases, so does the risk for some diseases. Some common conditions related to overweight and obesity include: premature death, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, some cancers and diabetes. Data comes from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), repeated every 5 years. The results of the study enable to get to know the health situation of the inhabitants of the Union and its conditions in connection with the demographic and social characteristics and the place of residence.

The amount of expenditures included in NHA, in accordance with the applicable methodology, covers current expenditures, so it does not include capital expenditure, which includes, for example, investment expenditures, research and development, education. The source of information for NHA in the area of public spending (HF.1), which consists of government diagrams, obligatory schemes - insurance premiums, are, among others, administrative systems of institutions which collect data on expenditure on health care (i.e. Ministry of Health, National Health Fund, Social Insurance Institution, Agricultural Social Insurance Fund, Ministry of the Interior and Administration, Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, State Fund for Rehabilitation of Disabled People). The results of other research carried out as part of the program of statistical surveys of official statistics and other available sources of information, mainly for estimating private expenditure, are also used. Based on the classification of the health care function (ICHA-HC), two types of expenditures were distinguished: expenditures on individual services and expenditures on collective services. Individual services are medical products and services used directly by individual persons according to their needs, belonging to the functional categories: curative care (HC.1), rehabilitative care (HC.2), long-term care (health) (HC.3), ancillary services (non-specified by function) (HC.4) and medical goods (non-specified by function) (HC.5). Collective services are services that can be applied to all population groups, belonging to the functional categories preventive care (HC.6) and governance and health system and financing administration (HC.7).",

The index for 2011 was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2.5 concentrations in 2010-2011 in 2012. For 2012 and subsequent years, the national average exposure indicator is calculated as the arithmetic average of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations from the last three years (eg for 2015 the indicator was calculated in 2016 as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations for 2013-2015). For the purposes of calculating national indicator, 30 measuring stations were created whose locations were approved by the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection. Measuring stations are located in areas with a very high population density remote from dust emission sources. In cities over 100,000 inhabitants and agglomerations not exceeding 1 million inhabitants, these measurements are carried out on one measuring station. In the Warsaw Agglomeration and the Upper Silesian Agglomeration, measurements are carried out on two measurement stations. Detailed information on the location of air pollutant measuring stations PM2,5 for the purposes of calculating KW are included in voivodship environmental monitoring programs. Measurements are made using low-flow PM2.5 dust collectors, i.e. the reference method by voivodships inspectorates for environmental protection. Measurements are carried out continuously.",

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using the continuous observation method (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter.

The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week:  - performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed in a company/public institution or by a private employer, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture, - had work but did not perform it:   • due to illness or holiday leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, childcare, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (work system or overtime collection), training related to the performed work, • due to the seasonal character of the work, if they still regularly performed off-season their work or business conducting related tasks and responsibilities (excluding legal or administrative obligations), • for other reasons, if the anticipated break in employment did not exceed 3 months.  In accordance with international standards, among employees are also included apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). The employed do not include: volunteers and interns who do not receive remuneration, people working in private engaged in the production of agricultural products solely or mainly for their ownneeds. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 who simultaneously fulfil three conditions:  - within the reference week were not employed, - were actively looking for work, i.e. for over 4 weeks (the reference week being the fourth one) had been involved in concrete actions aimed at finding a job, - were available to take up work within two weeks after the reference week.  Persons who were not seeking work because they had already found a job, were only waiting to start work within the period no longer than 3 months, and were available for this job are also included in the category of the unemployed. Among school-leavers are included persons at the age 15-30 years who completed school during the last 12 months and who do not continue education.",

Due to the changes introduced, the LFS results are not fully comparable with the survey results for the years prior to 2021.

PISA tests (developed by an international consortium, with the cooperation of the countries participating in the project) are different from typical school activities, and on the basis of the results, the level of student skills is estimated. The best students reach level 5 or 6 (tasks with a relatively high degree of difficulty), while results below level 2 - a minimum level of competence - indicate very basic skills, which means an higher risk of not coping with education and adult life.

The aim of the programme is to verify the practical application of knowledge acquired in school and outside the school. The survey (representative) is carried out in randomly selected schools, and depending on the type of school, it covers randomly selected students aged 15-16 (results are generalized to the entire population). The success of the survey depends on the participation of all sampled schools and students. PISA standards only allow a small-scale denial. PISA tests students skills in three subject areas: reading and interpretation, mathematics and scientific literacy. The survey is carried out every three years since 2000. In each of the subsequent surveys, a particular emphasis is put on the examination of one area (reading and interpretation - in 2000 and 2009), which takes half of the time provided for the student to solve the entire set of tasks. PISA tests (developed by an international consortium, with the cooperation of the countries participating in the project) are different from typical school activities, and on the basis of the results, the level of student skills is estimated. The best students reach level 5 or 6 (tasks with a relatively high degree of difficulty), while results below level 2 - a minimum level of competence - indicate very basic skills, which means an higher risk of not coping with education and adult life. PISA is one of the most important and the biggest educational surveys, which aims to provide objective and internationally comparable data on the same year students' skills.",

The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. The employment rate is the share of employed in a given category in the total population of the same category. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week: 1. performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed in a company/public institution or by a private employer, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture, 2. had work but did not perform it: • due to illness or holiday leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, childcare, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (work system or overtime collection), training related to the performed work • due to the seasonal character of the work, if they still regularly performed off-season their work or business conducting related tasks and responsibilities (excluding legal or administrative obligations) • for other reasons, if the anticipated break in employment did not exceed 3 months According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). The employed do not include: volunteers and interns who do not receive remuneration, people working in private engaged in the production of agricultural products solely or mainly for their own needs.",

Kgoe –  kilogram of oil equivalent (contractual), is a unit of measurement of energy used in international balance sheets. It indicates the amount of energy that can be produced from the combustion of one metric kilogram of crude oil. One tonne of oil is equal to the contractual 41.868 GJ or 11.63 MWh. Gross domestic product presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy in a given year. GDP value can be calculated in three ways: - from the production side GDP is the sum of value added of all institutional sectors or all sections of the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) of domestic production entities plus taxes less subsidies on products, - from the distribution side GDP is calculated as the sum of domestic demand, i.e. final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation as well as external balance of goods and services, - as the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes less subsidies on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy). Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",

It describes high technology section and is mainly used in foreign trade analysis. Classification of the products was created on the basis of the analysis of content of R&D component ('content of technology'). For measurement/ intensification of the R&D intensity the following indicators are used: the ratio of direct R&D costs to the value added, the ratio of direct R&D costs to the production value (sales), the ratio of direct R&D costs extended by indirect costs incorporated in investment goods and intermediate products to the production value (sales). The current list of high technology products includes 9 groups of products whose production requires high expenditures on R&D: aerospace, computers - office machinery, electronics - telecommunications, pharmacy, scientific instruments, electrical machinery, non-electrical machinery, chemistry and armament. Export means shipping abroad the goods that have been produced in the given country. Foreign trade in high technology is one of the methods of estimating the extent to which R&D and solutions produced in the given country are converted to high-tech goods that can be sold on the global market. The following 9 product groups are included in the high technology products according to OECD SITC Rev. 4 list (validated by Eurostat in April 2009): 1. Aerospace (among others helicopters, aeroplanes and other aircraft, spacecraft and spacecraft launch vehicles, propellers and rotors and parts thereof, aeroplane motors, direction finding compasses); 2. Computers - office machinery (among others computers, multifunction office machines);  3. Electronics – telecommunications (among others video apparatus, sound recording or reproducing apparatus operated by coins, bank cards, etc., printed circuits, optical fibre cables, microwave tubes, semiconductor devices; optical media); 4. Pharmacy (among others antibiotics, hormones and their derivatives); 5. Scientific instruments (among others electrodiagnostic apparatus for medicine or surgery and radiological apparatus, dental drill engines, measuring instruments and apparatus, photographic cameras, cinematographic cameras, contact lenses, optical fibres, orthopaedic appliances); 6. Electrical machinery (among others electric sound or visual signaling apparatus, electrical capacitors, fixed, variable or adjustable); 7. Non-electrical machinery (among others gas turbines, nuclear reactors and parts thereof, machinery and apparatus for isotopic separation, machine-tools working by laser or other light or photon beam, lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, machines and apparatus for resistance welding of metal); 8. Chemistry (among others selenium, tellurium, phosphorus, arsenic and boron, silicon, radioactive materials, synthetic organic colouring matter and colour lakes, insecticides, disinfectants); 9.

During a given period, an enterprise's innovation activities may be of three kinds: successful in having resulted in the implementation of a new innovation; ongoing, work in progress, which has not yet resulted in the implementation of an innovation and abandoned before the implementation of an innovation. Innovation survey is conducted on the basis of international methodology (Oslo Manual). Expenditures incurred on innovation activities in the scope of product and business process innovations include expenditures incurred in a given reporting year. All expenditures on product and business process innovations are taken into consideration in an innovation survey, that is, current and capital expenditures incurred within a reporting period on successful (i.e. having resulted in the implementation of an innovation), ongoing and abandoned activities, irrespective of their source of funding.

The level of GCI index includes connections between particular pillars. Properly connected pillars form 3 subindexes, on which GCI index is based: subindex based on the basic development factors: 1-4 pillarssubindex based on the efficiency enhancement factors: 5-10 pillarssubindex based on the innovation and sophistications factors: 11-12 pillars The value of subindexes reflects assignment of countries to a given group of economy, remaining in one of three stages of development: I stage - factor-driven stage;II stage - efficiency-driven stage;III stage - innovation-driven stage. Weights of three subindexes were defined during GCI index construction. The main criterion for defining weights is the level of economic development measured by the value of GDP per capita and influence of natural resources extraction on economy. The values of 114 variables included in the GCI index are mainly from annual survey conducted by the World Economic Forum, which is additionally supplemented with data gathered from UN agencies, e.g. UNESCO, WHO, the International Monetary Fund.",

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15-89 who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. Outside the scope of the survey are members of households staying (the total duration of actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as staff hotels, dormitories, boarding schools, nursing homes, etc.) and homeless people. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and ecomically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Unemployed according to LFS are persons aged 15-74 who simultaneously fulfil three conditions: - within the reference week were not employed, - were actively looking for work, i.e. for over 4 weeks (the reference week being the fourth one) had been involved in concrete actions aimed at finding a job, - were available to take up work within two weeks after the reference week. Persons who were not seeking work because they had already found a job, were only waiting to start work within the period no longer than 3 months, and were available for this job are also included in the category of the unemployed. The LFS results allow the unemployed to be classified into one of four categories: unemployed who lost their jobs, i.e., those who left their last job not on their own initiative and immediately (i.e., within three months) began looking for work, unemployed who quit their jobs, i.e., those who left their jobs on their own initiative and immediately began looking for work, unemployed who return to work after a break during which they did not look for work for a minimum of three months, unemployed who have never worked and are looking for their first ever job. Long-term unemployed - according to the national definition, these are unemployed people looking for a job for 13 months or more; while according to the definition used by Eurostat, these are unemployed people looking for a job for 12 months or more.",

Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of Eurostat. Regional accounts are a subsystem of national accounts, in which the economic activity of all entities of the national economy is grouped in territorial sections - according to macroregions, regions and subregions. Regional accounts are developed in accordance with the rules of the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). For sub-regions, the following items are calculated: gross domestic product (GDP) and gross value added (GVA) by type of activity groups (by local type of activity type). For conversions per capita, the population was assumed as of 30 VI, taking into account the results of the 2011 National Population and Housing Census.

Weight 1,0 is assigned to the first adult, weight 0,5 is assigned to every next adult and weight 0,3 is assigned to each child under 14.

Because the assessment of noise pollution is subjective, it should be noted that the indicator accounts for both the levels of noise pollution as well as people's standards of what level they consider to be acceptable. Therefore, an increase in the value of the indicator may not necessarily indicate a similar increase in noise pollution levels but also a decrease of the levels that European citizens are willing to tolerate and vice versa. The indicator is calculated on the basis of information obtained from the EU-SILC survey. EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behavior or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview technique using 2 questionnaires; one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Central Statistical Office of Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household).

Units with a higher value of the indicator are characterized by higher availability.  The indicator is built on the basis of a potential accessibility model, for which the attractiveness of the travel/transport destination (population in passenger transport and population and GDP in freight transport) decreases with increasing travel/transport time.  The value of the indicator depends on changes in the network (transport) and changes in population or GDP. For this reason, there are no adopted maximum MAI values.  There are two versions of the indicator: MAI I  (used in research in 2008 and 2010) anT MAI II. Since 2013, the MAI indicator has been calculated according to the verified methodology (MAI II), which provides full opportunities to study changes in accessibility since Poland's accession to the European Union. The creation of the MAI II indicator was related to the needs of evaluating transport investments financed in 2014–2020, as well as enabling full monitoring of progress in the implementation of strategic documents.  The indicator is based on the potential availability model. In the version of MAI II, poviat was replaced by gmina as the basic unit for which the value of the indicator is measured.  The MAI indicator has no units of measure (it is a feature of potential accessibility). It was assumed that centers with a higher value of the indicator (which in the MAI I model could take a value from 0 to 1, and in the MAI II model can take various positive values) are characterized by higher transport accessibility.  A detailed description of the verified methodology for using the the MAI II indicator is included in the notification 'Estimation of the expected results of intervention using measures of transport accessibility adapted to the needs of strategic and operational documents of the transport perspective 2014–2020 (updated 2020/2021)' at: http://www.ewaluacja.gov.pl",

These indicators are calculated as three-year moving averages from measurements of PM2.5 concentrations for individual cities and agglomerations (e.g. indicators for cities and agglomerations for 2018 were calculated as the average of annual average PM2.5 concentrations from 2016-2018 for these cities and agglomerations). The calculations take into account the results of measurements from 32 measuring stations selected in accordance with the requirements for conducting measurements in this area. In every city with more than 100 thous. inhabitants and in each agglomeration there is one measurement station, the results of which are used to calculate it (the exceptions are the agglomerations: Upper Silesia and Warsaw, where there are two measurement stations). The number of agglomerations and cities with more than 100 thous. inhabitants where the average exposure indicator does not exceed the exposure concentration obligation, is calculated by summing all the cities with more than 100 thous. inhabitants and agglomerations where the average exposure indicator for PM 2.5 has not exceeded 20 µg/m3 in a current year. The exposure concentration ceiling is the concentration of a substance in the air, determined on the basis of the value of the national average exposure indicator, in order to limit the harmful effects of a given substance on human health, which is to be achieved within a specified period. The exposure concentration ceiling is an air quality standard and has been specified only for PM2.5 dust. The exposure concentration ceiling applies to urban background areas in cities with more than 100 thous. inhabitants. inhabitants and in agglomerations and was defined by the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of August 24, 2012 on the levels of certain substances in the air (Journal of Laws of 2012, item 1031). The value of the PM2.5 exposure concentration ceiling is 20 µg/m3. The calculation method of AEI is defined in the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of September 13, 2012 on the Method for Calculation of Average Exposure Indicator and Method for Assessment of Achieving Exposure Concentration Obligation (Journal of Laws of 2012, item 1029). List of agglomerations and cities over 100 thous. inhabitants in which the value of the average exposure indicator does not exceed the limit of PM2.5 exposure concentration for a given calendar year is published in Monitor Polski by September 30 of the following year.",

The circular material use (CMU) rate is defined as the ratio of the circular use of materials to the overall material use. The overall material use is measured by summing up the aggregate domestic material consumption (DMC) and the circular use of materials. DMC is defined in economy-wide material flow accounts. The circular use of materials is approximated by the amount of waste recycled in domestic recovery plants minus imported waste destined for recovery plus exported waste destined for recovery abroad. Waste recycled in domestic recovery plants comprises the recovery operations R2 to R11 - as defined in the Waste Framework Directive 75/442/EEC. The imports and exports of waste destined for recycling - i.e. the amount of imported and exported waste bound for recovery - are approximated from the European statistics on international trade in goods. A higher CMU rate value means that more secondary materials substitute for primary raw materials thus reducing the environmental impacts of extracting primary material.",

Greenhouse gases are components of the Earth's atmosphere, which due to their physicochemical properties have the ability to retain solar energy within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Greenhouse gases refer to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (NH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for several years to thousands of years. They have an impact on the global climate, regardless of where they are emitted. The indicator is calculated excluding the balance of CO2 emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector (land use, land use change and forestry) and including indirect CO2  emissions.",

The use of RES significantly reduces the harmful impact of energy on the environment, notably by reducing emissions, especially greenhouse gases. In national conditions energy from renewable sources includes energy from solar radiation, water, wind, geothermal resources and energy generated from solid biofuels, biogas and liquid biofuels as well as ambient energy obtained by heat pumps.

Separately, for each of 46 zones annual assessment is made of protection of human health for 12 pollutants (SO2, NO2, benzene, CO, O3, particulate matter PM 10, particulate matter PM 2,5, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene). On the basis of this assessment for each pollutant a class (A, B or C) is subscribed. • A class is assigned to the zone in the area of which, no exceedances were observed. • Class B is attributed to the zone which has exceeded the permissible level, but not exceeded the permissible level increased by the margin of tolerance. • Class C - is attributed to the area where, in a given year exceedances of acceptable levels augmented by the margin of tolerance or exceedances of target level were observed. Since 2015 for none of the above mentioned pollutants the margin of tolerance was specified, thus starting from the air quality assessment for 2015, depending on the pollutant concentrations, the zone can be only classified as A or C. For the indicator calculations cumulative assessment of area class is taken based on the criteria laid down for the protection of health for all pollutants for which air quality standard (acceptable levels) were specified. This applies to the results of the classification of zones for SO2, NO2, benzene, CO, particulate PM matter 10, particulate matter PM 2,5). The zone is included in the zones where in a given year exceedances of the air quality standard were observed if the permissible level increased by the margin of tolerance, is exceeded in the area of the zone for one or more of the above mentioned pollutants. In calculating the air quality index, exceedances identified on the basis of the target value is not taken into consideration, because according to the Act of 27 April 2001 - Environmental Protection Law  (Journal of Laws from 2013,  item 1232 with later amendments),  target value is not an air quality standard. The result of the calculation is expressed as a percentage according to the formula: air quality index = (number of zones with exceedance of limit values / 46) • 100%",

The index for 2011 was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2.5 concentrations in 2010-2011 in 2012. For 2012 and subsequent years, the national average exposure indicator is calculated as the arithmetic average of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations from the last three years (eg for 2015 the indicator was calculated in 2016 as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations for 2013-2015). For the purposes of calculating national indicator, 30 measuring stations were created whose locations were approved by the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection. Measuring stations are located in areas with a very high population density remote from dust emission sources. In cities over 100,000 inhabitants and agglomerations not exceeding 1 million inhabitants, these measurements are carried out on one measuring station. In the Warsaw Agglomeration and the Upper Silesian Agglomeration, measurements are carried out on two measurement stations. Detailed information on the location of air pollutant measuring stations PM2,5 for the purposes of calculating KW are included in voivodship environmental monitoring programs. Measurements are made using low-flow PM2.5 dust collectors, i.e. the reference method by voivodships inspectorates for environmental protection. Measurements are carried out continuously.",

The model's emission estimation methodology is consistent with the applicable IPCC and EEA guidelines used in international reporting. Pollution from means of road transport comes mainly from fuel combustion processes in car engines, abrasion of tires, brake pads in cars and secondary entrainment of dust from road surfaces. The volume of emissions from the transport sector is mainly influenced by the number and age of vehicles, the condition of road surfaces and traffic organization. Pollutants emission from road transport facilities includes: • Carbon dioxide • Methane • Nitrous oxide • Carbon oxide • Non-methane volatile organic compounds • Nitrogen oxides • Particulates (as Total Suspended Particulates) • Sulphur dioxide • Lead",

The coastal flooding is most frequently caused by storm wind blowing on the seacoasts in the coast direction. The storm wind hampers outflow of the rivers flowing into the sea, building up water in the river beds and sea lagoons as well as causing seawater intrusion in the estuaries. Coastal Protection Program - a multiannual program conducted pursuant to the Act of 28 March 2003 on the establishment of the multiannual program 'Coastal Protection Program'.",

This indicator is specified for action A. Raising awareness of invasive alien species entering the natural environment threats and ways to reduce them - which consists of the following tasks: • A.1. Production of films aimed at terrarists, aquarists, breeders of exotic animals, fishermen and gardeners. The films will inform about the ways of introducing invasive species of plants or animals into the environment in Poland, the consequences of releasing or escaping individuals of these species into the natural environment and about the legal regulations in this regard; • A.2. Preparation and publication of thematic articles in the press, on the website or in social networking sites regarding legal provisions relating to the introduction of invasive species of plants and animals into the environment and describing ways to prevent the escape of alien species of ornamental plants from crops and alien species of domestic animals and species kept in aquariums and terrariums; • A.4. Promotion of the code of good practice 'Gardening against invasive plants of foreign origin' and its ongoing updating; • A.5. Conducting educational campaigns to promote issues related to the problem of invasive species entering the natural environment: ornamental plant species in non-commercial horticultural crops and pets, species used in aquaristics and terrariums, as well as issues related to animal asylums.

Maximum Sustainable Yield is understood as the largest catch that can be taken from fish stocks for an period. The aim of this threshold is to achieve maximum efficiency of fish stocks while maintaining biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems relevant to present and future generations. Fish stocks are considered to be sustainable if their numbers persist at a level that ensures maximum sustainable yield or higher. In order to ensure that basic industrial species in the Baltic Sea are operated at a renewable level, Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 has been drawn up and adopted establishing a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks (amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007). This regulation specifies the maximum level of fishing (maximum sustainable yield) of the species in question by imposing conservation obligations, including maintaining or restoring populations of target species at renewable levels. The indicator adopts four dimensions, i.e .:1. proportion of fully exploited fish stocks2. proportion of fish stocks not fully exploited3. proportion of fish stocks over-exploited) and4. proportion of stocks within sustainable biological limit Sustainable levels include those fish stocks which, according to the stock assessment, were classified as 'not fully exploited' and 'fully exploited'. The indicator is calculated as the sum of these two categories divided by the total number of fish species subject to resource assessment and multiplied by 100. The assessment of stocks includes fish stocks as defined in Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council for which a multi-annual plan has been established:1. Atlantic cod in the western part of the Baltic Sea2. Atlantic cod in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea3. Atlantic herring in the western part of the Baltic Sea4.

The index for 2011 was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2.5 concentrations in 2010-2011 in 2012. For 2012 and subsequent years, the national average exposure indicator is calculated as the arithmetic average of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations from the last three years (eg for 2015 the indicator was calculated in 2016 as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations for 2013-2015). For the purposes of calculating national indicator, 30 measuring stations were created whose locations were approved by the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection. Measuring stations are located in areas with a very high population density remote from dust emission sources. In cities over 100,000 inhabitants and agglomerations not exceeding 1 million inhabitants, these measurements are carried out on one measuring station. In the Warsaw Agglomeration and the Upper Silesian Agglomeration, measurements are carried out on two measurement stations. Detailed information on the location of air pollutant measuring stations PM2,5 for the purposes of calculating KW are included in voivodship environmental monitoring programs. Measurements are made using low-flow PM2.5 dust collectors, i.e. the reference method by voivodships inspectorates for environmental protection.

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: - 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), - 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), - 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: - bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, - multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2021” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.  Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) - the countries with the lowest levels of socio-economic development, which meet the following three criteria: average income per capita below $ 1018 for 3 years, low human resources (malnutrition, high mortality, low level of education) and the sensitivity of the economy (dependence on the production of raw materials or agricultural products). The list of LDCs covers about 50 countries (most of them are African countries). Gross National Income (GNI) - the gross primary income of all property sectors or all national institutional sectors it is the sum of gross domestic product and income from abroad.",

Therefore, the indicator did not cover expenditures within multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to the general budgets of international organisations working in the area of official assistance. Since 2018, the leading ODA indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there is no differentiation into net and gross ODA.

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: - 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), - 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), - 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: - bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, - multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2021” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.  Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) - the countries with the lowest levels of socio-economic development, which meet the following three criteria: average income per capita below $ 1018 for 3 years, low human resources (malnutrition, high mortality, low level of education) and the sensitivity of the economy (dependence on the production of raw materials or agricultural products). The list of LDCs covers about 50 countries (most of them are African countries). Gross National Income (GNI) - the gross primary income of all property sectors or all national institutional sectors it is the sum of gross domestic product and income from abroad.",

                                          "methodology": "Official Development Assistance (ODA) comprises grants and loans that are provided by government agencies or international organizations to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %)  15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%).  ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recepients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into bilateral and multilateral. Bilateral assistance is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation. Multilateral assistance is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. The indicator is calculated on the basis of total ODA commitments identified by Rio markers for climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation with assigned scores 1 or 2.  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2021” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.",

Therefore, the indicator does not cover contributions to the general budgets of organisations, such as UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme), which operate within the scope of climate change. Since 2018, the indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there will be no differentiation into net and gross ODA in that respect. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation. The presented indicator (7.a.1 Official Development Assistance for climate change mitigation and adaptation) in the total number of heads of agricultural holding) is a proxy indicator to the one adopted in the official list of indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The replacement of the original indicator (7.a.1 International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon.",

Under the IPA programme, the beneficiaries of twinning projects include, among others, the candidate countries for the European Union, while the ENPI program is intended for countries covered by the neighborhood and partnership policy. Twinning is primarily a partnership cooperation between public institutions from the donor and recipient countries. This cooperation consists in transferring to the recipient country the experience of the donor country related to the implementation of EU law, and it also allows to establish long-term contacts between cooperation partners. Twinning projects are mainly implemented through specialist training in the beneficiary's country and study visits to the institutions of the donor country, according to the rules set out by the European Commission in the so-called Twinning Manual. Public administration units and entities with the status of the so-called Mandated Body can participate in the implementation of twinning projects. TAIEX (Technical Assistance and Information Exchange) is the technical assistance and information exchange instrument of the European Commission. TAIEX supports public administrations in the approximation, application and enforcement of EU legislation and facilitates the sharing of EU best practices. It is largely needs-based and provides relevant, tailor-made expertise to resolve issues within a short period of time in three ways: Workshops: experts from EU Member States present specific areas of EU legislation in workshops for a large number of beneficiary officials. Expert missions: experts from EU Member States are sent to the beneficiary's administration to provide specific advice on the transposition, implementation or enforcement of a specific piece of EU legislation. Study visits: a group of five practitioners from the beneficiary's administration take part in a study visit to the administration of an EU Member State",
