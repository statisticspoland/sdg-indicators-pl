The worst indicator decides about final assessment. Classification of the uniform water bodies to the moderate or worse ecological status/potential, or to the bad chemical status, shows the bad status of waters, what informs that during evaluated period the uniform water body did not comply the assigned requirements of environmental goals. When the result of assessment showed at least good ecological status/potential, but the chemical status was not assessed or chemical status was good, but it was impossible to classify the ecological status/potential, it was impossible to define the final assessment of the status of uniform water bodies. The assessment of monitored uniform rivers and lakes water bodies was completed with extrapolation or expert assessment of the rest of waters. In the accepted method, when there was no data for precised classification of the ecological status/potential, “at least good” or “below good” classification was assigned, what enabled to define the final assessment of the status. Due to the cyclical planning and programming in water management in Poland, data on quality of surface water relate to the cycles 2010 –2015 for lakes and for rivers (the lakes were monitored in voivodships, and the rivers across the country).",

Poland acceded to the convention on 22 march 1978 The convention's mission is the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development accross the world. According to the Ramsar Convention wetlands are '...areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres'. The Ramsar Contracting Parties, including Poland, have committed themselves to designate suitable wetlands for the List of Wetlands of International Importance, work towards the wise use of all their wetlands through national land-use planning, appropriate policies and legislation, management actions, and public education and to cooperate internationally in the implementation of the convention. There are 13 Ramsar Sites on the List of Wetlands of International Importance, in Poland:  Biebrzanaki National Park (59 233 ha, since 1995) Slowinski National Park (32 744 ha, since 1995) Wigry National Park (15 085 ha, since 2002) Poleski National Park (9 764 ha, since 2002) Narew River National Park (7 350 ha, since 2002) Milicz Fishponds Nature Reserve (5 324 ha, since 1995) Warta River Mouth National Park (8 074 ha, since 1984) Druzno Lake Nature Reserve (3 068 ha, since 2002) Lake of Seven Islands Nature Reserve (1 618 ha, since 1984) Luknajno Lake Nature Reserve (1 189 ha, since 1977) Swidwie Lake Nature Reserve (891 ha, since 1984) Karas Lake Nature Reserve (815 ha, since 1984) Subalpine peatbogs in Karkonosze Mountains (40 ha, since 2002) ",

Data in EW-MFA tables, in units of mass, are created for the following components: 1. Biomass and biomass products. 2. Metal ores and concentrates, raw and processed. 3. Non-metallic minerals, raw and processed. 4. Fossil energy materials/energy carriers, raw and processed. 5. Other products. 6. Waste imported for final processing and removal.  Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products less subsidies on products. Resource productivity provides information on whether there is decoupling of economic growth and natural resource use and, by implication, reduction of the negative impact of the economy on the environment. The resource productivity indicator is presented at constant prices as of 2010 (euro/kg) – for comparison of resource productivity in time for a single territorial unit.",

GDP is the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products less subsidies on products.

The aim of the Partnership is to integrate representatives of various circles in cooperation for effective achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The initiative increases the awareness of the SDGs, adopted by the international community, their importance for individual social groups and the need to cooperate in their effective implementation. The signatories provide an example of active involvement and responsible implementation of the principles of sustainable development within the organisation, providing a valuable source of inspiration for others. The cooperation of a wide group of stakeholders reflects Poland's efforts to actively involve public and private entities, non-governmental organizations, the science sector and civil society in the planning and implementation of development activities. This is to ensure wider communication, increase awareness of the need for cooperation and dialogue. The signatories join the Partnership during conference events organized by the national coordinator of implementing SDGs in Poland – the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology (until January 2018 – the Ministry of Economic Development). During the ceremony of joining the Partnership, the Signatories on one common Partnership Card, successively sign the following declarations: “Aware of global economic, social and environmental challenges and their complexity, we see sustainable development as an opportunity to create a new economic reality, opening new paths of development for business, based on the principles of transparency and building the image of Poland as a reliable economic partner. We recognise that ambitious goals and targets will be achieved through working together in an effective manner, mobilising forces, creating synergies, a lively and strengthened partnership, the result of dialogue that is open to all stakeholders. In an effort to jointly exploit opportunities for change in the country, region and enterprise, to increase the impact on sustainable development, we express our intention to cooperate within the framework of this partnership initiative for the achievement of the SDGs.”",
