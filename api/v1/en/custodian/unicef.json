The lower the deviation value, the more observations are focused around the average. The indicator is calculated on the basis of information obtained from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS).

Neonatal deaths - deaths of children under 4 weeks of age (0-27 days). 0 day indicates the age of a live born neonate, who did not survive 24 hours. The infant mortality rate is also referred to as neonatal mortality. The following deaths are distinguished: - early neonatal deaths, i.e. occurred within the first 7 days of life (0-6 days) (early infant mortality), - late neonatal deaths, i.e. occurred after the completion of the 7th day of life, but before the completion of 28 days of life. The source of data on death is the document of the Ministry of Health Death certificate, which is basic document for civil status acts and is in the part secondarily utilized by national statistics (Regulation of the Minister of Health, Journal of Laws 2015, item 231). Live birth - the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of an infant, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of the voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta has been separated each such a product is considered as live born. The coefficient is calculated on the basis of death data from the survey Deaths. Mortality. Life Expectancy' and based on live births from the survey 'Birth.

Respondents were selected using the random selection method. Standard interviews conducted within the framework of the study included questions about physical, sexual and psychological violence, including acts of violence on the part of partners (domestic violence). The study also included questions about persistent stalking, sexual harassment, the role of new technologies in abuse-related experiences and violence in childhood.In the FRA study, women were asked to distinguish the events that took place after they were 15 years of age (during a specified period of life) and events from the 12 months preceding the interview.Questions about partner violence related to any violence that occurred during the relationship. The current partners are those who are married or registered as a partner, live together without marriage or are involved in a relationship without living together. Persons who previously remained in one of the above-mentioned forms of the union are considered as former partners. The results referring to the experiences of women with any partner are based on the answers of the respondents who had at least one previous partner in the course of the study.",

Water supply is a composite of engineering equipment and technical objects, whose task is to provide the population and industry in the water of the required quantities and properties corresponding to its destination. Requirements for the quality of water intended for human consumption, including bacteriological, physico-chemical and organoleptic characteristics determines the regulation of the Minister of Health of 13 November 2015 on the quality of water intended for human consumption (Journal of Laws of 2015, item 1989). Data on urban population connected to water supply and sewage systems comprise the population inhabiting residential buildings connected to a particular network. Due to a change in the estimation method, data from 2014, are not fully comparable with the data presented in previous years. The starting point for data estimation are the results of the National Census of Population and Housing. The data is then corrected by adding information on change of the number of completed buildings and the number of dwellings per one building (based on reports on residential buildings and dwellings in non-residential buildings completed and reports on losses of dwelling stock). The indicator of the number of persons per one dwelling comes from the balance of dwelling stocks. This is the number of actually residing population, as of December 31 in a given year, divided by the number of dwellings. Information on the newly connected or disconnected buildings is derived from the report on water supply system, sewage system and liquid waste stored in septic tanks.",

In principle, the ideal situation happens when the indicator value equals 100, but it can be attained only under rational and compact building development. When analyzing the indicator, not only the investment opportunities of municipalities (gminas) should be taken into account, but also the natural conditions and the nature of the building development, resulting in lower indicator values in rural areas and areas with varied landscaping. The starting point for data estimation are the results of the National Census of Population and Housing. The data is then corrected by adding information on change of the number of completed buildings and the number of dwellings per one building (based on reports on residential buildings and dwellings in non-residential buildings completed and reports on losses of dwelling stock). The indicator of the number of persons per one dwelling comes from the balance of dwelling stocks. This is the number of actually residing population, as of December 31 in a given year, divided by the number of dwellings. Information on the newly connected or disconnected buildings is derived from the report on water supply system, sewage system and liquid waste stored in septic tanks. Data on the population connected to water supply and sewage system since 2014, due to a change of the estimation method, are not fully comparable with the data presented for previous years. According to the Law of 7 June 2001 on the public water supply and sewage collection, an active sewerage network is a system of covered canals (underground) discharging sewage from buildings and other objects to collectors or waste water treatment facilities.",

The birth of a child must be reported to the Civil Status Office within 21 days of the date of Birth card compiled by the entity performing therapeutic activity (for a still birth within 3 days). The Birth certificate is compiled by the Civil Status Office at the same day the birth declaration takes place. The birth certificate for the child includes, among others:  • name and surname of the child,  • country, date and place of birth,  • sex,  • surname, first and last names, date and place of birth of the parents of the child. Compiling a Birth certificate for the child allows to give the PESEL number that is necessary for its identification in state registers. Situations when the birth of a child is not reported to the civil status office are treated as crimes, and may involve the case of concealment of the child, i.e. when the birth of a child occurs without the involvement of a medical subject and then the child does not use health services, educational facilities, etc. (what means lack of knowledge of child's existence).",
