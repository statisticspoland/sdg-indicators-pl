Malignant neoplasm - according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10: disease symbol C00-C97 - it expands in an infiltrative way, ie. it does not push surrounding tissue (as would benign neoplasm), but it penetrates between the cells of normal tissue, giving metastases. Diabetes - according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10: disease entity symbol E10-E14 - a metabolic disease caused by a deficiency or malfunction of insulin, resulting in elevated levels of sugar in the blood - hyperglycemia. Chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) - according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10: disease symbol J30-J98 - diseases of the airways and other structures of the lung. Some of the most common are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension.

They are a set of guidelines, rights and obligations imposed on both the states and the World Health Organization (WHO). International Health Regulations aim at combating and preventing the spread of diseases on an international scale by applying proportionate measures to avoid unnecessary interference with international transport. These regulations regulate the transmission and exchange of information on health hazards between the countries that are party to it and set new standards for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. According to the Article 4 of the International Health Regulations, Poland, as each Member State of the WHO (State Party), designates or establishes the National Focal Point for International Health Regulations. The National Focal Point for International Health Regulations was established at the National Institute of Public Health - National Institute of Hygiene. The Chief Sanitary Inspectorate co-operates with the National Focal Point for International Health Regulations, so that they receive information about events that pose public health threats to the international sign. Since 15th of June 2007, all countries that have ratified the WHO Convention, including Poland, are required to comply with the provisions of the International Health Regulations. The quality and level of the following attributes are taken into account in assessing the implementation of the International Health Regulations:    1. national legislation, policy and financing,   2. coordination and National Focal Point communications,   3. surveillance,   4. response,   5. preparedness,   6. risk communication,   7. human resources,   8. laboratory,   9. points of entry,   10. zoonotic events,   11. food safety,   12. chemical events,   13. radionuclear emergencies.

Respondents were selected using the random selection method. Standard interviews conducted within the framework of the study included questions about physical, sexual and psychological violence, including acts of violence on the part of partners (domestic violence). The study also included questions about persistent stalking, sexual harassment, the role of new technologies in abuse-related experiences and violence in childhood.In the FRA study, women were asked to distinguish the events that took place after they were 15 years of age (during a specified period of life) and events from the 12 months preceding the interview.Questions about partner violence related to any violence that occurred during the relationship. The current partners are those who are married or registered as a partner, live together without marriage or are involved in a relationship without living together. Persons who previously remained in one of the above-mentioned forms of the union are considered as former partners. The results referring to the experiences of women with any partner are based on the answers of the respondents who had at least one previous partner in the course of the study.",

The types and amount of pollutants in industrial wastewater are very diverse. They depend on the type of industry, type of raw materials used in production and the production technology used. In statistics, the industrial wastewater also include cooling water, polluted and saline waters from mine drainage and sewage works as well as social and living wastewaters related to manufacturing processes.  Data on industrial wastewater refer to sewage discharged by the entities, which according to Polish Classification of Activity were included under 'Industry' covering ”Mining and quarrying”, ”Manufacturing”, ”Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply” and “Water supply  sewerage, waste management and remediation activities” as well as other sections, whose share in the volume of discharged sewage is insignificant. Industrial wastewater requiring treatment means sewage discharged via a network of open canals or ditches directly to waters, ground or sewage network from production entities (including water contaminated as a result of dehydration of mines and contaminated waters used in industry for cooling). Municipal wastewater means domestic wastewater or mixture of domestic wastewater with industrial sewage and rainwater disposed of by a commune through sewage water system and wastewater treatment plants.Data on municipal wastewaters cover sewage discharged via a sewage network by the units managed by water supply and sewage companies and plants established by a voivode (or managed by territorial self-local governments) and from 1994 all units supervising collective discharge of sewage via sewage network (including housing cooperatives, water companies, water service plants, enterprises etc.) Prior to discharge to the recipient, all the sewage should be treated. Thus, in the statistics, the wastewater means wastewater requiring treatment. The data do not include precipitation and infiltration water discharged via sewage network. Wastewater treated is wastewater subjected to the process of adjusting to environmental standards or other quality standards. Three methods are distinguished: mechanical, chemical and biological processes or increased biogene removal (including chemical). For the purpose of calculating the total amount of treated wastewater, only the amount which was subjected to the highest mentioned biogene removal is presented. Therefore, wastewater treated mechanically and biologically should be reported as wastewater treated biologically and the wastewater treated using all methods should be reported as treated using increased biogene removal method. Wastewater requiring treatment is wastewater which prior to discharge to the recipient, should undergo treatment processes.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2021” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.",

Therefore, the indicator did not cover expenditures within multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to the general budgets of organisations also working in the water and sanitation sector. Since 2018, the leading ODA indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there is no differentiation into net and gross ODA. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation."

Clean fuel is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion. The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices comes from about 1300 nationally representative survey and censuses. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), and other nationally developed and implemented surveys. Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a given country and year are obtained together using a single multivariate hierarchical model. Using household survey data as inputs, the model jointly estimates primary reliance on 6 specific fuel types:  ∙ unprocessed biomass (e.g. wood),   ∙ charcoal,   ∙ coal,   ∙ kerosene,   ∙ gaseous fuels (e.g. LPG),   ∙ electricity;   and a final category including other clean fuels (e.g. alcohol).",
