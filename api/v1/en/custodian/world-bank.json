Aiming at elimination of differences in measuring poverty of people living in different countries purchasing power parities (PPP) were used.PPPs are types of currency exchange rates that are used to convert economic indicators expressed in local currencies to a common conventional currency. As the socio-economic realities evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated. TThe current threshold was set in September 2022. Prior to that, in the 2015 update the World Bank set the international poverty line at $1.9, and before - at $1.25 (according to the update from 2008).",

EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) The subject of the EU-SILC are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of the European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). StatisticsPoland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: - 1 - for the first adult household member, - 0.5 - for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, - 0.3 - for every child in the household under 14. And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2.1 times as high as that for a 1-person household.",

The way that country-wide sample was selected ensured representativeness of the survey results for Poland's population aged 15+ with respect to sex, age and place of residence (locality LAU-1, LAU-2 and voivodship NUTS-2 size). The randomness in respondent selection was ensured thanks to:  • locality sampling in individual classes,  • address sampling (street and number),  • applying the procedure of random route. Locality and address sampling was carried out via Statistics Poland's central catalogue of streets (ULIC), being part of the system of the address identification of streets, real properties, buildings and dwellings (NOBC) (https://bip.stat.gov.pl/dzialalnosc-statystyki-publicznej/rejestr-teryt/zakres-rejestru-teryt/).",

Presented work may also contain the results of research being in the development phase. Moreover, this research has been conducted in an innovative way using experimental methods and a new methodological approach. The results of the experimental statistics are not official statistics.The indicator was calculated by Statistical Office in Olsztyn basing on the methodology proposed by the United Nations using data from three databases: two databases maintained by Head Office of Land Surveying and Cartography (GUGiK) (the BDOT10k and PRG databases) as well as the WorldPop database.The Topographic Objects Database (BDOT10k) is a vector database containing the spatial location of topographic features along with a basic description of their properties. The content and detail level of the BDOT10k database generally corresponds to a traditional topographic map at the scale of 1:10,000. Database contains information on road type and category, road surface type, as well as road width and length.The National Register of Boundaries (PRG) is an official reference database providing  the basis for other spatial information systems and using data concerning administrative units of the country. The PRG covers the area of the whole country and contains information about boundaries and areas of the fundamental three-level administrative division of the country (i.e. gminas, powiats, and voivodships), registration units, registration precincts, special borders, as well as addresses and their spatial location.The WorldPop database contains high-resolution global data on the distribution of the human population in the form of a 100x100m raster. The datasets provide an estimate of the number of people living in each grid cell.In order to calculate the index, the following steps were carried out: 1. Exclusion of the city areas and designation of a mask for rural areas analysis based on data from the PRG database. 2. Designation of the roads from the BDOT10k database that meet the 'all-season road' condition, with the exception of city areas. 3. Designation of a road buffer with a radius of 2 kilometres. 4. Calculation of population within the buffer limits based on WorldPop database data and total population for rural areas. 5. Calculation of the indicator.",

EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by:  property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office.  For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows:  1 for the first adult household member, 0.5 for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, 0.3 for every child in the household under 14.  And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2,1 times as high as that for a 1-person household. A household is classified into a given quintile groups on the basis of per capita available income in that household. Thus members of all the households in the survey are listed according to the increasing per capita available income using the weights applied in the survey and divided into five groups, equal in number of the weighted persons. The first quintile (I) consists of 20% of persons with the lowest incomes, while the fifth quintile (V) 20% of persons with the highest incomes.",

EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: 1 - for the first adult household member, 0.5 - for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, 0.3 - for every child in the household under 14.",

The exact definition and methodology for calculating GDP is contained in the regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010). GDP value can be calculated in three ways:  • from the production side GDP is the sum of value added of all institutional sectors or all sections of the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) of domestic production entities plus taxes less subsidies on products,  • from the distribution side GDP is calculated as the sum of domestic demand, i.e. final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation as well as external balance of goods and services,  • as the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes less subsidies on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy).  Personal remittances comprise personal transfers and compensation of employees. Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by non-resident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees. The methodology used is in line with the Sixth Edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6).",

One of the components of public debt is the State Treasury debt (two other components are local government debt and social security debt). Treasury debt is the government's commitment to cover, amon others, the budget deficit. State Treasury debt typically accounts for about 90% of public debt. The cost of debt service is the state budget expenditure. The costs of debt service includes primarily interest and discount on treasury securities, interest and fees on loans and borrowings received, costs of issuing treasury securities and payments under sureties and guarantees granted by the Treasury. Exports include the value of goods leaving the country within the framework of trade transactions as well as the value of services, among others, transport, construction and communications, net processing turnover, printing services, financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM). The value of exports includes estimated balance of purchases made by Polish citizens abroad as well as purchases made by foreigners in Poland.",
