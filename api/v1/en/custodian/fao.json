It allows monitoring trends in the extent of dietary energy deficit. The indicator is a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the households' ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time. Undernourishment is defined by FAO as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements. While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, the indicator can only be referred to a population, or group of individuals (due to conceptual considerations). The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in that group, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished.",

The plant genetic resources are calculated on the basis of the database containing the number of objects and associated data. Information is available at: http://egiset.ihar.edu.pl/index.aspx?lang=en-GB of IHAR-PIB. The database includes resources stored in the gene bank collections, in various forms, located at IHAR Radzików (central seed storage) and in a number of other institutions, including the Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice, the Arboretum and the Department of Physiography in Bolestraszyce  Polish Academy of Sciences Botanical Garden - Center for Biological Diversity Conservation in Powsin  Warsaw University of Life Sciences - SGGW  Poznan University of Life Sciences  Society of Friends of the Lower Vistula River in Gruczno  Plant Breeding of Poznań LLC in Tulce  Institute of Natural Fibres and Medicinal Plants in Poznań  Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation - NRI in Puławy. The number of  livestock genetic resources is calculated on the basis of ex situ in vitro and ex situ in vivo methods. There are the following methods to protect the animal population from extinction:  in situ - the protection of living animals in their natural environment, ex-situ-protection of genetic resources beyond their natural habitat, including:   ex-situ in vitro - cryopreserved material in banks of genetic material, ex situ in vivo - collections of live animals kept away from the place of occurrence  In the case of ex situ in vivo collections, in order for them to be considered long-term and stable, it is assumed that they are in public sector institutions.",

There are the following methods to protect the animal population from extinction:  in situ - the protection of living animals in their natural environment, ex-situ-protection of genetic resources beyond their natural habitat, including:   ex-situ in vitro - cryopreserved material in banks of genetic material, ex situ in vivo - collections of live animals kept away from the place of occurrence.

An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a governments orientation to the agriculture sector.",

Mine water and drainage water as well as water abstractions from precipitation are included, whereas water used for hydroelectricity generation (in situ use) is excluded. For the calculation of water productivity Eurostat uses the GDP either in the unit of EUR in chain-linked volumes to the reference year 2010 at 2010 exchange rates or in the unit PPS (Purchasing Power Standard). The unit EUR in chain linked volumes allows observing the water productivity trends over time in a single geographic area, whereas the unit PPS allows to compare countries for the same year. Since GDP is measured in million EUR or million PPS and water abstraction in million cubic meters, water productivity is available in both EUR per m3 and PPS per m3.",

Maximum Sustainable Yield is understood as the largest catch that can be taken from fish stocks for an period. The aim of this threshold is to achieve maximum efficiency of fish stocks while maintaining biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems relevant to present and future generations. Fish stocks are considered to be sustainable if their numbers persist at a level that ensures maximum sustainable yield or higher. In order to ensure that basic industrial species in the Baltic Sea are operated at a renewable level, Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 has been drawn up and adopted establishing a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks (amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007). This regulation specifies the maximum level of fishing (maximum sustainable yield) of the species in question by imposing conservation obligations, including maintaining or restoring populations of target species at renewable levels. The indicator adopts four dimensions, i.e .:1. proportion of fully exploited fish stocks2. proportion of fish stocks not fully exploited3. proportion of fish stocks over-exploited) and4. proportion of stocks within sustainable biological limit Sustainable levels include those fish stocks which, according to the stock assessment, were classified as 'not fully exploited' and 'fully exploited'. The indicator is calculated as the sum of these two categories divided by the total number of fish species subject to resource assessment and multiplied by 100. The assessment of stocks includes fish stocks as defined in Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council for which a multi-annual plan has been established:1. Atlantic cod in the western part of the Baltic Sea2. Atlantic cod in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea3. Atlantic herring in the western part of the Baltic Sea4.
