GVA indicates the input of individual producers, industries and sectors to the GDP creation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission per unit of value added is a universal indicator for measuring the impact of industrial production on environment. It captures the intensity of energy use, energy efficiency of production technology and most importantly use of fossil fuels.",
