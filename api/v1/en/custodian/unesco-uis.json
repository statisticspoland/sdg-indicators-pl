Programme for International Student Assessment - PISA is internationally coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and in Poland by the Ministry of National Education. The aim of the programme is to verify the practical application of knowledge acquired in school and outside the school. The survey (representative) is carried out in randomly selected schools, and its results are generalized to the entire population. The success of the survey depends on the participation of all sampled schools and students. PISA standards only allow a small-scale denial. PISA tests students skills in three subject areas: Reading and Interpretation, Mathematics and Scientific literacy. The survey is carried out every three years, since 2000. In each of the subsequent surveys, a particular emphasis is put on the examination of one area, which takes half of the time provided for the student to solve the entire set of tasks. PISA tests (developed by an international consortium, with the cooperation of the countries participating in the project) are different from typical school activities, and on the basis of the results, the level of student skills is estimated. The best students reach level 5 or 6 (tasks with a relatively high degree of difficulty), while results below level 2 - a minimum level of competence - indicate very basic skills, which means an higher risk of not coping with education and adult life. PISA is one of the most important and the biggest educational surveys, which aims to provide objective and internationally comparable data on the same year students skills.",

Data for the indicator comes from the Study of the use of Information and Communication Technologies in households and by individuals. The study of the use of information and communication technologies in households and by individual users began in the European Union (EU) in 2002, using mainly the method of direct or telephone interview.In Poland, the study on the use of ICT in households according to a methodology harmonized with the EU began in 2004. It is carried out annually and participation in it is voluntary. The survey is carried out using the direct interview method, and from 2018 also via the online self-census method. It covers households with at least one person aged 16-74 and people at that age. The indicators relate to the percentage of people with total digital skills (by level: low, basic, secondary) and information, communication, problem solving and software skills (by level: basic, secondary). Data have been presented since 2015, when the digital skills methodology was last revised.The skill level is calculated on the basis of a list of activities related to the use of the computer, software or the Internet, including:   copying or moving a file or folder, use of spreadsheets, transferring files between your computer and other devices, changing the settings of any software or operating system, creating presentations or documents combining text, pictures, tables or graphs, sending and receiving e-mails.

Parity index is a ratio of one quantity to the other (within a given index). The quantity referring to the group in a less privileged situation is usually captured in the numerator of a fraction. When the index equals 1, there is equality between the groups. The more the index value differs from 1, the bigger the disproportion between the groups.  Gender parity index is a ratio of given indexvalues for women and men.   The gender parity indices in education are calculated on the basis of the following indicators:  4.1.1.b Percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in reading   for gender parity index in reading at the end of lower-secondary school, 4.1.1.c Percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in mathematics - for gender parity index in mathematics at the end of lower-secondary school, 4.2.2 Participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age) - for gender parity index in pre-primary education for 6-year-old children.

The PIAAC study allows for directly measurement of three competencies: • literacy  • numeracy  • ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. In addition, PIAAC provides information about the relationship between skills and intensity of their use, education, educational activity and labor market situation. International Program of Adult Competencies is coordinated internationally by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and in Poland by the Institute for Educational Research. A representative of the Ministry of National Education represented Poland in a Board of Participating Countries, e.i. in a group that manages the development, implementation and monitoring of the study. In the first round of the PIAAC study (2008-2013) 24 countries were participating, out of which 22 are OECD members. A total of 166 thousand persons aged 16-65 were examined (including 9.4 thousand in Poland). Work on the study concept was undertaken in 2008. In most countries, the study covered the period from August 2011 to March 2012. Publication of results and completion of the first round of PIAAC took place in October 2013. The second round of study (2012-2016) covered 9 further countries and its results were announced in June 2016. Currently, the third round of study (2016-2019) is underway, which will concern the next 6 countries.and its results (international report and datasets) will be published in October 2023. The PIAAC study adopted a contractual scale of competence ranging from 0 to 500 points. This scale has been divided into: • 6 skill levels (1 to 5 and below 1) - in terms of literacy and numeracy • 4 skill levels (1 to 3 and 1 below) - in terms of ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. The higher the level, the better the skill. People with the highest level of understanding of text or mathematical reasoning are assigned 4 or 5 skill levels, and in terms of solving problems in technology-rich environments - level 3. In both cases, people with the weakest results are classified as 1 or less than 1.",

In addition,as follows from the the above regulation, public toilets require the separation of sanitary facilities for men and women [para. 85(1)] and the provision of hand washing devices [para. 84(2)]. The Regulation of the Minister of National Education and Sport of 31 December 2002 on safety and hygiene in public and non-public schools and institutions (Journal of Laws of 2003 No. 6, item 69, as amended) regulates access to drinking water. In the absence of a water supply network, another source of water that meets the requirements for drinking water is provided in schools and institutions. Taking into account the above regulations it should be assumed that 100% of schools in Poland have access to electricity and drinking water, as well as separate sanitary facilities for men and women and hand washing devices. Otherwise they could not be used for educational purposes. Data on the percentage of schools with computer labs and schools with access to the Internet are derived from the Education Information System of the Ministry of Education.",

It involves three types of activities, that is, basic research, applied research (including industrial) and experimental development. Intramural expenditures on R&amp D include expenditures on R&amp D performed within a statistical unit, whatever the source of funds. They involve both current and capital expenditures linked to R&amp D activities. Current expenditures on R&amp D include personnel costs as well as costs of used materials, non-durable articles and energy, costs of external services (other than R&amp D ) including external processing, transport, renovation, banking, postal, ICT, publishing or municipal services, costs of business trips and other current costs including, in particular, taxes and fees charging costs of activity and profits, property insurance, and equivalents for the benefit of employees – in a part in which they relate to R&amp D . Capital expenditures on R&amp D include expenditures on new fixed assets linked to R&amp D and, since 2016, costs of computer hardware used in reasearch and development activities for more than one year (charges for using the product of intellectual property by another entity as well as expenditures on software developed on one's own), costs of purchased patents, long-term licenses or other non-material and legal values that are used in research and development activities for more than one year. Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is equal to the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products and decreased by subsidies on products. Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",

R&D personnel, apart from conducting R&D activities, may also arrange and manage R&D projects, prepare reports, provide direct ICT, library and documentation maintenance in a given project as well as provide administrative services in the area of finance and human resources. Researchers (i.e. professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects) constitute the most numerous group of R&D personnel.The group ‘pracownicy naukowo-badawczy’ is a Polish equivalent of the researchers group (presented in Frascati Manual), also named as ‘scientists and engineers’. Belonging into this group requires neither formal qualifications nor occupying a specific post. Full-time equivalents (FTE) are conversion units used to determine actual employment in R&D . One full-time equivalent (FTE) means one person-year devoted exclusively to R&D activities. Employment in R&D in full-time equivalents is calculated on the basis of the ratio of working time devoted to R&D by particular employees within a reporting year to full working time on a particulate position in a given institution. Full-time equivalent is the only measure of employment in R&D used in international comparisons and international publications issued by OECD and EUROSTAT.",
