Data for the indicator comes from the Study of the use of Information and Communication Technologies in households and by individuals. The study of the use of information and communication technologies in households and by individual users began in the European Union (EU) in 2002, using mainly the method of direct or telephone interview.In Poland, the study on the use of ICT in households according to a methodology harmonized with the EU began in 2004. It is carried out annually and participation in it is voluntary. The survey is carried out using the direct interview method, and from 2018 also via the online self-census method. It covers households with at least one person aged 16-74 and people at that age. The indicators relate to the percentage of people with total digital skills (by level: low, basic, secondary) and information, communication, problem solving and software skills (by level: basic, secondary). Data have been presented since 2015, when the digital skills methodology was last revised.The skill level is calculated on the basis of a list of activities related to the use of the computer, software or the Internet, including:   copying or moving a file or folder, use of spreadsheets, transferring files between your computer and other devices, changing the settings of any software or operating system, creating presentations or documents combining text, pictures, tables or graphs, sending and receiving e-mails.

In Poland, monitoring of the ICT usage in households in accordance with the EU harmonized methodology was launched in 2004. Since then, the survey has been carried out annually and voluntary participation is ongoing. The study is carried out through face-to face interviews and includes households with at least one person aged 16-74 and people of that age. Two separate questionnaires: for households (SSI-10G) and individuals: (SSI-10I) are used in this survey. Mainly qualitative questions (not related to values given in numbers) and closed questions are utilized. Individual questionnaires include questions regarding:  â¢ computer and Internet usage (when lately ?, how often ?, where?)   â¢ Internet usage via mobile devices   â¢ purposes of Internet usage   â¢ making purchases online.",
