As the socio-economic realities evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated. TThe current threshold was set in September 2022. Prior to that, in the 2015 update the World Bank set the international poverty line at $1.9, and before - at $1.25 (according to the update from 2008).",

The module survey is an additional survey implemented at the same time as the basic survey allowing to extend the scope of information obtained in the basic survey. Since 2017, the observation period of the modular survey 'Unregistered employment in Poland' has covered 12 months of the year (previous editions of the survey covered a period of 9 months, i.e. months from January to September). The extension of the observation period made it possible to assess the scale of the phenomenon throughout the year. Due to the change introduced, the comparability of the time series of data prior to 2017 is limited. In addition, the lack of comparability of the time series for data from 2022 onwards is also affected by methodological changes concerning the definition of the employed person introduced in the basic LFS from Q1 2021. (data on employed persons are used in the denominator when calculating the indicator). Unregistered unemployment is defined as: - employment performed without employment relationship, that is, without a contract, order-agreement, contract for a particular task/work or any other written agreement between the employer and employee, regardless of the ownership sector (also in private households and in private farms) unregistered work cannot be performed on the basis of call, appointment, or election performing unregistered work does not entitle the employee to social security and, by implication, to the right to social benefits the duration of that work is not counted as contribution from the viewpoint of Social Insurance Institution the employer does not allot contribution from the employee's wages and salaries to Social Insurance Institution and Labour Found income taxes are not deducted from income generated through unregistered employment, - self-employment if the concluded economic activity does not meet financial obligations to the state (e.g. taxes).  The employed from 2021 onwards, according to the LFS definition, include all persons aged 15-89 years (previously it was persons aged 15 years and over) who during the survey week: - have been engaged for at least 1 hour in work that generates earnings or income, i.e. have been employed by a public company/institution or private employer, have worked on their own (or leased) farm or have been self-employed outside agriculture, have assisted (without remuneration) in running a family farm or a family business outside agriculture, - had work but did not perform it due to:  â€¢ due to illness, or leave of absence, parental leave (maternity, parental, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (working arrangements or receipt of overtime), job-related training, â€¢ due to the seasonal nature of the work, if they continued to regularly fulfil work or business-related tasks and duties (excluding legal or administrative duties) during the off-season, â€¢ for other reasons, if the expected period of absence from work does not exceed 3 months. In accordance with the international standards, among the employed, there are also included apprentices who entered into occupational training or occupational preparation contract with a private or public employer if they received remuneration.",

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15-89 who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. Outside the scope of the survey are members of households staying (the total duration of actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as staff hotels, dormitories, boarding schools, nursing homes, etc.) and homeless people. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and ecomically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. The employed are defined as all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week: 1. performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed by a public company/institution or private employer,, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in work on family agricultural farm or in conducting family economic activity outside agriculture, 2. had work but did not perform it due to: â€¢ sickness, or rest leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, parental, paternity or childcare), organization of working time (work system or overtime receipt), job-related training, â€¢ the seasonal nature of the work, if they continued to regularly fulfill work or business-related tasks and duties (excluding legal or administrative duties) during the off-season, â€¢ other reasons, if the expected period of absence from work does not exceed 3 months - did not exceed 3 months. In accordance with the international standards, among the employed, there are also included apprentices who entered into occupational training or occupational preparation contract with a private or public employer if they received remuneration. The employed do not include: volunteers and unpaid interns, people working in individual agriculture engaged in the production of agricultural products exclusively or primarily for their own consumption. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 who simultaneously fulfil three conditions: â€¢ within the reference week were not employed, â€¢ were actively looking for work, i.e. for over 4 weeks (the reference week being the fourth one) had been involved in concrete actions aimed at finding a job, â€¢ were available to take up work within two weeks after the reference week. Persons who were not seeking work because they had already found a job, were only waiting to start work within the period no longer than 3 months, and were available for this job are also included in the category of the unemployed.",

Data for 2021-2022 were compiled according to the new basis of generalisation. Due to the changes introduced, the LFS results are not fully comparable with the survey results for the years prior to 2021. In addition, the lack of comparability of the data time series is also affected by methodological changes introduced to the LFS from Q1 2021. Data for 2010-2020 have been recalculated and presented taking into account the new methodology. These recalculations do not take into account the change in the basis for generalising data to balances based on the Census 2021.",

Outside the scope of the survey are members of households residing (the total duration of actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as staff hotels, dormitories, dormitories, nursing homes, etc.) and homeless persons. The basic criterion for dividing the population from the point of view of labor force participation is work, i.e. the fact of doing, having or seeking work. According to international standards, the general population can be divided into three basic categories: employed, unemployed and economically inactive. The employed and unemployed constitute the economically active population.",

Data for 2021-2022 were compiled according to the new basis of generalisation. Due to the changes introduced, the LFS results are not fully comparable with the survey results for the years prior to 2021. In addition, the lack of comparability of the data time series is also affected by methodological changes introduced to the LFS from Q1 2021. Data for 2010-2020 have been recalculated and presented taking into account the new methodology. These recalculations do not take into account the change in the basis for generalising data to balances based on the Census 2021.",

The indicator builds on five basic elements:  â€¢ the premises of definitional validity, reproducibility and transparency  â€¢ the 108 evaluation criteria used to code violations in law and practice (each with their own specific detailed definitions)  â€¢ the textual sources selected for coding  â€¢ the general and source-specific coding rules   â€¢ the rules to convert the coded information into normalized indicators.",

Weights for these evaluation criteria are assigned based on the use of the Delphi survey method of expert consultation. Indicator are normalized to range zero to 10 (best to worst possible score) with breakdowns for overall freedom of association and collective bargaining rights as well as these rights in law and in practice. Textual sources:  â€¢ Reports of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations  â€¢ Reports of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards  â€¢ Country Annual Reviews under the ILO Declaration  â€¢  Representations under Article 24 of the ILO Constitution  â€¢ Complaints under Article 26 of the ILO Constitution  â€¢ National legislation. Information from these sources is coded according to 108 evaluation criteria representing different types of FACB rights violations, such as: 1. Violations of fundamental civil liberties. 2. Workersâ€™ right to establish and join organizations. 3. Rights concerning the internal functioning of these organizations. 4. Rights to collective bargaining. 5. The right to strike. These categories are themselves split into violations of FACB rights in law and in practice:  â€¢ violations in law refer to national legislation that is not in conformity with FACB rights as defined by the ILO as well as to actions taken on the basis of such legislation,  â€¢ violations in practice refer to acts committed and in violation of the existing national legislation that is in conformity with FACB rights as defined by the ILO. Overall violations are the sum of violations in law and in practice.

Wages and salaries concern amounts booked in activity costs for a given period and, therefore, do not include payments from profit and balance surplus in cooperatives. Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is equal to the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products and decreased by subsidies on products. Gross domestic product is calculated according to obligatory in the European Union countries principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010) and recommendations of the Eurostat.",
