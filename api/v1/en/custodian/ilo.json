Aiming at elimination of differences in measuring poverty of people living in different countries purchasing power parities (PPP) were used. PPPs are types of currency exchange rates that are used to convert economic indicators expressed in local currencies to a common conventional currency. As the socio-economic realities evolve, the international poverty line has to be periodically updated. The current threshold was set in October 2015. Prior to that, in the 2008 update the World Bank set the international poverty line at $1.25.",

The employed are defined as all persons aged 15 and more who during the reference week:  – performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in work on family agricultural farm or in conducting family economic activity outside agriculture,  – had work but did not perform it due to:  ​ sickness, maternity leave, paternal leave or vacation,  ​ other reasons but the break in employment:  - did not exceed 3 months,  - excedeed 3 months but these persons worked as employees and during that period received at least 50% of the hitherto remuneration. In accordance with the international standards, among the employed, there are also included apprentices who entered into occupational training or occupational preparation contract with a private or public employer if they received remuneration.",

The indicator builds on five basic elements:  • the premises of definitional validity, reproducibility and transparency  • the 108 evaluation criteria used to code violations in law and practice (each with their own specific detailed definitions)  • the textual sources selected for coding  • the general and source-specific coding rules   • the rules to convert the coded information into normalized indicators.",

Weights for these evaluation criteria are assigned based on the use of the Delphi survey method of expert consultation. Indicator are normalized to range zero to 10 (best to worst possible score) with breakdowns for overall freedom of association and collective bargaining rights as well as these rights in law and in practice. Textual sources:  • Reports of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations  • Reports of the Conference Committee on the Application of Standards  • Country Annual Reviews under the ILO Declaration  •  Representations under Article 24 of the ILO Constitution  • Complaints under Article 26 of the ILO Constitution  • National legislation. Information from these sources is coded according to 108 evaluation criteria representing different types of FACB rights violations, such as: 1. Violations of fundamental civil liberties. 2. Workers’ right to establish and join organizations. 3. Rights concerning the internal functioning of these organizations. 4. Rights to collective bargaining. 5. The right to strike. These categories are themselves split into violations of FACB rights in law and in practice:  • violations in law refer to national legislation that is not in conformity with FACB rights as defined by the ILO as well as to actions taken on the basis of such legislation,  • violations in practice refer to acts committed and in violation of the existing national legislation that is in conformity with FACB rights as defined by the ILO. Overall violations are the sum of violations in law and in practice.
