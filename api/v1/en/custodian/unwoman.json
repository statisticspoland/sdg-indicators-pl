The study also included questions about persistent stalking, sexual harassment, the role of new technologies in abuse-related experiences and violence in childhood.In the FRA study, women were asked to distinguish the events that took place after they were 15 years of age (during a specified period of life) and events from the 12 months preceding the interview.Questions about partner violence related to any violence that occurred during the relationship. The current partners are those who are married or registered as a partner, live together without marriage or are involved in a relationship without living together. Persons who previously remained in one of the above-mentioned forms of the union are considered as former partners. The results referring to the experiences of women with any partner are based on the answers of the respondents who had at least one previous partner in the course of the study.",

The legislative bodies (i.e constituting) of local government units include gmina council, powiat council and voivodship regional council. Members of these bodies (councilors) are elected for a four-year term. The gmina council is a constituting and controlling body in the gmina.  The executive authority in rural gminas is exercised by a village mayor, in urban and urban-rural gminas - by a mayor, and by a president - in big cities (of over 100,000 residents and in cities in which the executive and managing body was the city president on the day when the act on local self-government came into force, i.e on 27 May 1990 - this concerned cities with more than 50,000 residents and former capitals of voivodships).",
