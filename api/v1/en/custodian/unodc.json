Respondents were selected using the random selection method. Standard interviews conducted within the framework of the study included questions about physical, sexual and psychological violence, including acts of violence on the part of partners (domestic violence). The study also included questions about persistent stalking, sexual harassment, the role of new technologies in abuse-related experiences and violence in childhood.In the FRA study, women were asked to distinguish the events that took place after they were 15 years of age (during a specified period of life) and events from the 12 months preceding the interview.Questions about partner violence related to any violence that occurred during the relationship. The current partners are those who are married or registered as a partner, live together without marriage or are involved in a relationship without living together. Persons who previously remained in one of the above-mentioned forms of the union are considered as former partners. The results referring to the experiences of women with any partner are based on the answers of the respondents who had at least one previous partner in the course of the study.",

Trade means export, re-export, import and introduction from the sea, whereas re-export means export of any specimen that has previously been imported. Appendix I lists species that are the most endangered or which are or may be subject to commercial activity.Trade in these species should be under particular supervision in order to present further threat to their existence and may be permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Appendix II lists:  • all species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so, unless trade is closely controlled to prevent exploitation which cannot be reconciled with their preservation and  • some specimen, which should be subject to supervision for the purpose of efficient control of trade in species enlisted in Appendix II. Appendix III is a list of species included at the request of a Party that already regulates trade in the species and that needs the cooperation of other countries to prevent unsustainable or illegal exploitation. Total number of CITES speciments for 2010-2015 specifies the number of alive plants and animals. In addition:  • for year 2010: in total - 8286 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 70 specimens (70 kg) of frozen European eel.  • for year 2011: in total - 2m3 Swietnia spp. wood and 3000 seeds of cactus Astrophytum asterias as well as 9594 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM).  • for year 2012: in total - 8217 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 7 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2013: in total - 2137 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 2 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2014: in total - 2040 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 1 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2015: in total - 9986 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 7 specimens of ivory.",

Trade means export, re-export, import and introduction from the sea, whereas re-export means export of any specimen that has previously been imported. Appendix I lists species that are the most endangered or which are or may be subject to commercial activity.Trade in these species should be under particular supervision in order to present further threat to their existence and may be permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Appendix II lists:  • all species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so, unless trade is closely controlled to prevent exploitation which cannot be reconciled with their preservation and  • some specimen, which should be subject to supervision for the purpose of efficient control of trade in species enlisted in Appendix II. Appendix III is a list of species included at the request of a Party that already regulates trade in the species and that needs the cooperation of other countries to prevent unsustainable or illegal exploitation. Total number of CITES speciments for 2010-2015 specifies the number of alive plants and animals. In addition:  • for year 2010: in total - 8286 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 70 specimens (70 kg) of frozen European eel.  • for year 2011: in total - 2m3 Swietnia spp. wood and 3000 seeds of cactus Astrophytum asterias as well as 9594 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM).  • for year 2012: in total - 8217 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 7 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2013: in total - 2137 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 2 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2014: in total - 2040 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 1 specimens of ivory.  • for year 2015: in total - 9986 speciments of Asian medicine medicines (TAM), 7 specimens of ivory.",

The source of data on death is the document of the Ministry of Health Death certificate, which is basic document for civil status acts and is in the part secondarily utilized by national statistics (Regulation of the Minister of Health, Journal of Laws 2015, item 231).

EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Respondents were asked 'How safe do you feel to be alone in your neighborhood after dark?' Possible answers were: very safe, rather safe, rather dangerous, very dangerous, do not go alone after dark, because I feel dangerous, do not go alone after dark for other reasons. To calculate the indicator, the category do not go alone after dark, because I feel dangerous was excluded.",

Preventive measures are used to safeguard the correct course of conduct, and exceptionally also to prevent a new serious crime from being committed by the accused. They can only be used if the evidence gathered indicates a high probability that the defendant committed a crime. Apart from temporary arrest, the remaining preventive measures are non-custodial and include: guarantee, supervision, suspend in official or occupation, ban from leaving the country and stop driving licence. Temporary arrest can only be made by a court order and is a final measure only if another preventive measure is insufficient. Temporary arrest is carried out in remand prisons. Remand prisons may be created as independent remand prisons or as separate prisons. Detention centers are subject to the Minister of Justice.",
