EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Central Statistical Office of Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. A household is understood as the persons may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Basic sanitation include a bathroom with bath and/or shower, flushable toilet with running water. Water supply means access to the tap with cold running water. The indicator does not include access to garbage disposal.",

The types and amount of pollutants in industrial wastewater are very diverse. They depend on the type of industry, type of raw materials used in production and the production technology used. In statistics, the industrial wastewater also include cooling water, polluted and saline waters from mine drainage and sewage works as well as social and living wastewaters related to manufacturing processes.  Data on industrial wastewater refer to sewage discharged by the entities, which according to Polish Classification of Activity were included under 'Industry' covering ”Mining and quarrying”, ”Manufacturing”, ”Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply” and “Water supply sewerage, waste management and remediation activities” as well as other sections, whose share in the volume of discharged sewage is insignificant. Industrial wastewater requiring treatment means sewage discharged via a network of open canals or ditches directly to waters, ground or sewage network from production entities (including water contaminated as a result of dehydration of mines and contaminated waters used in industry for cooling). Municipal wastewater means domestic wastewater or mixture of domestic wastewater with industrial sewage and rainwater disposed of by a commune through sewage water system and wastewater treatment plants.Data on municipal wastewaters cover sewage discharged via a sewage network by the units managed by water supply and sewage companies and plants established by a voivode (or managed by territorial self-local governments) and from 1994 all units supervising collective discharge of sewage via sewage network (including housing cooperatives, water companies, water service plants, enterprises etc.) Prior to discharge to the recipient, all the sewage should be treated. Thus, in the statistics, the wastewater means wastewater requiring treatment. The data do not include precipitation and infiltration water discharged via sewage network. Wastewater treated is wastewater subjected to the process of adjusting to environmental standards or other quality standards. Three methods are distinguished: mechanical, chemical and biological processes or increased biogene removal (including chemical). For the purpose of calculating the total amount of treated wastewater, only the amount which was subjected to the highest mentioned biogene removal is presented. Therefore, wastewater treated mechanically and biologically should be reported as wastewater treated biologically and the wastewater treated using all methods should be reported as treated using increased biogene removal method. Wastewater requiring treatment is wastewater which prior to discharge to the recipient, should undergo treatment processes.",

Presented work may also contain the results of research being in the development phase. Moreover, this research has been conducted in an innovative way using experimental methods and a new methodological approach. The results of the experimental statistics are not official statistics.The indicator was calculated by Statistical Office in Olsztyn basing on the methodology proposed by the United Nations using data from three sources: Sentinel satellite data, PRG database maintained by Head Office of Land Surveying and Cartography (GUGiK), as well as the WorldPop database.Sentinel satellite data - radiometric data (Sentinel 1 GRD) and optical data (Sentinel 2) with 10 m spatial resolution.The National Register of Boundaries (PRG) is an official reference database providing  the basis for other spatial information systems and using data concerning administrative units of the country. The PRG covers the area of the whole country and contains information about boundaries and areas of the fundamental three-level administrative division of the country (i.e. gminas, powiats, and voivodships), registration units, registration precincts, special borders, as well as addresses and their spatial location. The WorldPop database contains high-resolution global data on the distribution of the human population in the form of a 100x100 m raster. The datasets provide an estimate of the number of people living in each grid cell.In order to calculate the index, the following steps were carried out: 1. Determining the administrative borders of cities from the PRG database. 2. Designating a buffer with a radius of 2 km from the city limits (the growth of urbanized areas is mainly at the expense of rural gminas bordering cities). 3. Excluding underwater and arable land from the analysis (to increase the precision of the classification of built-up areas using satellite data). 4. Development of cloudless mosaics of radar and optical data and their masking to the analysed areas of cities and adjacent areas. 5. Determination of radiometric indicators for Sentinel-2 (NDVI, NBI, SAVI, BSI) and Sentinel-1 data (sigma nought in vertical polarization). 6. Execution of object based image classification and development of maps of urbanized areas, and calculation of their area for 2015 and 2020. 7. Development of a script automating calculations in the Google Earth Engine environment. 8. Calculating the number of people in the analysed area for the indicator for 2015 and 2020.",

Presented work may also contain the results of research being in the development phase. Moreover, this research has been conducted in an innovative way using experimental methods and a new methodological approach. The results of the experimental statistics are not official statistics.The indicator was calculated by Statistical Office in Olsztyn using data from five sources, basing on the methodology proposed by the United Nations: Sentinel satellite data, the BDOT10k and PRG databases maintained by Head Office of Land Surveying and Cartography (GUGiK), the WorldPop database and OpenStreetMap.Sentinel satellite data - radiometric data (Sentinel 1 GRD) and optical data (Sentinel 2) with 10 m spatial resolution.The Topographic Objects Database (BDOT10k) is a vector database containing the spatial location of topographic features along with a basic description of their properties. The content and detail level of the BDOT10k database generally corresponds to a traditional topographic map at the scale of 1:10,000. Database contains information on: road type and category, road surface type, as well as road width and length.The National Register of Boundaries (PRG) is an official reference database providing  the basis for other spatial information systems and using data concerning administrative units of the country. The PRG covers the area of the whole country and contains information about boundaries and areas of the fundamental three-level administrative division of the country (i.e. gminas, powiats, and voivodships), registration units, registration precincts, special borders, as well as addresses and their spatial location. The WorldPop database contains high-resolution global data on the distribution of the human population in the form of a 100x100m raster. The datasets provide an estimate of the number of people living in each grid cell.OpenStreetMap database is a community project aimed at creating a free, openly available map of the entire globe, editable by registered users. Data and maps based on the database are being published on the Open Database License.In order to calculate the index, the following steps were carried out: 1. Determining the administrative borders of cities from the PRG database. 2. Designating open spaces for public use for all within city limits (parks, squares, forests, playgrounds, other recreational areas) from OpenStreetMap database. 3. Determining the areas of land under the roads basing on BDOT10k database. 4. The built-up areas within city limits were determined with the use of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite data (methodology similar to that used for indicator 11.3.1): * Excluding underwater and arable land from the analysis (to increase the precision of the classification of built-up areas using satellite data), * Determination of radiometric indicators for Sentinel-2 (NDVI, NBI, SAVI, BSI) and Sentinel-1 data (sigma nought in vertical polarization), * Development of cloudless mosaics of radar data and optical data and their masking to the analysed areas of cities and adjacent areas, * Execution of object classification and development of maps of urbanized areas, and calculation of their area. 5. Calculating the indicators of open public spaces for public use for all in cities in general, by age and gender groups: * The geometry of the polygons of public spaces within the city limits was simplified using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm, the number of polygon vertices was reduced, and then the vertices of these polygons were separated, * Creating 100-meter buffers around the roads (assuming that the entry point to the OPS cannot be too far from the road), * Selecting the tops of the polygons located in a 100 m buffer from the roads (in order to designate entry points for large objects such as forests), * Designating the roads for which the pedestrian route to the OPS entrance is no longer than 400 m, * Designating a 100 m buffer for the routes to reach the OPS, * Calculating the indicator of the availability of open public spaces up to 400 m by gender and age.",

The replacement of the original indicator (11.a.1 ANumber of countries that have national urban policies or regional development plans that (a) respond to population dynamics; (b) ensure balanced territorial development; and (c) increase local fiscal space) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon.",
