EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) The subject of the EU-SILC are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of the European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). StatisticsPoland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by: property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office. For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows: - 1 - for the first adult household member, - 0.5 - for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, - 0.3 - for every child in the household under 14. And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2.1 times as high as that for a 1-person household.",

The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Central Statistical Office of Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. A household is understood as the persons may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Basic sanitation include a bathroom with bath and/or shower, flushable toilet with running water. Water supply means access to the tap with cold running water. The indicator does not include access to garbage disposal.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) - the countries with the lowest levels of socio-economic development, which meet the following three criteria: average income per capita below $ 750 for 3 years, low human resources (malnutrition, high mortality, low level of education) and the sensitivity of the economy (dependence on the production of raw materials or agricultural products). The list of LDCs covers about 50 countries (most of them are African countries).   Gross National Income (GNI) - the gross primary income of all property sectors or all national institutional sectors it is the sum of gross domestic product and income from abroad.

The indicator is a result of the combination of changes in the overall availability of food, in the households' ability to access it, and in the socio-demographic characteristics of the population, as well as differences across countries and regions in any given moment in time. Undernourishment is defined by FAO as the condition by which a person has access, on a regular basis, to amounts of food that are insufficient to provide the energy required for conducting a normal, healthy and active life, given his or her own dietary energy requirements. While the undernourishment condition applies to individuals, the indicator can only be referred to a population, or group of individuals (due to conceptual considerations). The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an estimate of the percentage of individuals in that group, but it does not allow for the identification of which individuals in the group are, in fact, undernourished.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), aligning with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. The agricultural sector includes support areas classified as sector 311 according to the OECD methodology (more information at: Aid to the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Rural Development sectors).",

The grant element is calculated specifically for tied aid credits. Additionally, work is underway to include other flows in ODA, e.g. amounts mobilized by the public sector from private sector instruments. Moreover, since 2019, Poland has been reporting a new TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) indicator, which measures the support provided for the implementation of the SDGs at the global level. The presented indicator (2.a.2 Official Development Assistance to the agriculture sector) is a proxy indicator to the one adopted in the official list of indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The replacement of the original indicator (2.a.2 Total official flows (official development assistance plus other official flows) to the agriculture sector) is due to the inability to obtain data for it.

ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. The health area includes, among others, areas of support classified to subsector 12182 and sector 122 according to the OECD methodology (more information at: (Aid to Health - OECD).",

The aim of the programme is to verify the practical application of knowledge acquired in and outside the school. The survey (representative) is carried out in randomly selected schools, and depending on the type of school, it covers randomly selected students aged 15-16 (results are generalized to the entire population). The success of the survey depends on the participation of all sampled schools and students. PISA standards only allow a small-scale denial.PISA tests students skills in three subject areas: reading, mathematics and science . The survey is carried out every three years, since 2000.  Poland has been participating in the study since its inception.PISA tests (developed by an international consortium, with the cooperation of the countries participating in the project) are different from typical school activities, and on the basis of the results, the level of student skills is estimated. The best students reach level 5 or 6 (ability to resolve tasks with a relatively high degree of difficulty), while results below level 2 - a minimum level of competence - indicate very basic skills, which means a higher risk of difficulties coping with education and adult life.PIRLS is the largest international study of reading comprehension in primary schools. The initiator and organizer of the study is the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) - an independent consortium of research organizations and government agencies from almost 70 member countries; in Poland it is coordinated by the Ministry of Education. The study involves students in their fourth year of schooling (due to the reforms in the compulsory school age in Poland, the achievements of third-graders were examined until 2011).The subject of measurement is reading in terms of literary experience (reading literary texts) and reading in order to obtain information (reading informational texts). The study has been carried out since 2001. Poland has been participating in the study since 2006.Based on the results obtained, the skill level of the student is estimated. The best students achieve level 5 (ability to separate important information from irrelevant information, drawing conclusions from premises scattered in the text, etc.), while results below level 2 - the minimum level of competence - indicate that they have only very basic skills (understanding only single sentences).Until 2016, the PIRLS survey in all countries was implemented only in a paper version. Since 2016, it is possible to carry out the survey in two versions: paper and digital. From 2026, the PIRLS survey will be conducted only in a digital version.",

It is carried out annually and participation in it is voluntary. The survey is carried out using the direct interview method, and from 2018 also via the online self-census method. It covers households with at least one person aged 16-74 and people at that age. The indicators relate to the percentage of people with total digital skills (by level: low, basic, secondary) and information, communication, problem solving and software skills (by level: basic, secondary). Data have been presented since 2015, when the digital skills methodology was last revised.The skill level is calculated on the basis of a list of activities related to the use of the computer, software or the Internet, including:   copying or moving a file or folder, use of spreadsheets, transferring files between your computer and other devices, changing the settings of any software or operating system, creating presentations or documents combining text, pictures, tables or graphs, sending and receiving e-mails.

Gender parity index is a ratio of given index values for women and men.   The gender parity indices in education are calculated on the basis of the following indicators:  4.1.1.b Percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in reading   for gender parity index in reading at the end of lower-secondary school, 4.1.1.c Percentage of students achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in mathematics - for gender parity index in mathematics at the end of lower-secondary school, 4.2.2 Participation rate in organized learning (one year before the official primary entry age) - for gender parity index in pre-primary education for 6-year-old children.

The PIAAC study allows for directly measurement of three competencies: • literacy  • numeracy  • ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. In addition, PIAAC provides information about the relationship between skills and intensity of their use, education, educational activity and labor market situation. International Program of Adult Competencies is coordinated internationally by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and in Poland by the Institute for Educational Research. A representative of the Ministry of National Education represented Poland in a Board of Participating Countries, e.i. in a group that manages the development, implementation and monitoring of the study. In the first round of the PIAAC study (2008-2013) 24 countries were participating, out of which 22 are OECD members. A total of 166 thousand persons aged 16-65 were examined (including 9.4 thousand in Poland). Work on the study concept was undertaken in 2008. In most countries, the study covered the period from August 2011 to March 2012. Publication of results and completion of the first round of PIAAC took place in October 2013. The second round of study (2012-2016) covered 9 further countries and its results were announced in June 2016. Currently, the third round of study (2016-2019) is underway, which will concern the next 6 countries.and its results (international report and datasets) will be published in October 2023. The PIAAC study adopted a contractual scale of competence ranging from 0 to 500 points. This scale has been divided into: • 6 skill levels (1 to 5 and below 1) - in terms of literacy and numeracy • 4 skill levels (1 to 3 and 1 below) - in terms of ability to solve problems in technology-rich environments. The higher the level, the better the skill. People with the highest level of understanding of text or mathematical reasoning are assigned 4 or 5 skill levels, and in terms of solving problems in technology-rich environments - level 3. In both cases, people with the weakest results are classified as 1 or less than 1.",

In addition,as follows from the the above regulation, public toilets require the separation of sanitary facilities for men and women [para. 85(1)] and the provision of hand washing devices [para. 84(2)]. The Regulation of the Minister of National Education and Sport of 31 December 2002 on safety and hygiene in public and non-public schools and institutions (Journal of Laws of 2003 No. 6, item 69, as amended) regulates access to drinking water. In the absence of a water supply network, another source of water that meets the requirements for drinking water is provided in schools and institutions. Taking into account the above regulations it should be assumed that 100% of schools in Poland have access to electricity and drinking water, as well as separate sanitary facilities for men and women and hand washing devices. Otherwise they could not be used for educational purposes.

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies.",

Respondents were selected using the random selection method. Standard interviews conducted within the framework of the study included questions about physical, sexual and psychological violence, including acts of violence on the part of partners (domestic violence). The study also included questions about persistent stalking, sexual harassment, the role of new technologies in abuse-related experiences and violence in childhood.In the FRA study, women were asked to distinguish the events that took place after they were 15 years of age (during a specified period of life) and events from the 12 months preceding the interview.Questions about partner violence related to any violence that occurred during the relationship. The current partners are those who are married or registered as a partner, live together without marriage or are involved in a relationship without living together. Persons who previously remained in one of the above-mentioned forms of the union are considered as former partners. The results referring to the experiences of women with any partner are based on the answers of the respondents who had at least one previous partner in the course of the study.",

A marriage is also concluded when a man and woman entering into a marriage, subject to the internal regulations of a church or other denominational association, in the presence of a priest, at the same time state their will to get married subject to Polish law. The Head of the Public Registry Office will afterwards draw up a marriage certificate. According to art. 10 1 of the Family and Guardianship Code, marriage cannot be concluded by a person who has not reached 18 years of age. However, for important reasons, the Court of guardians may authorize the marriage a woman who is over sixteen, and of the circumstances appears that the marriage will be in accordance with the best interests of the established families.",

The Senate consists of 100 senators. The Sejm and the Senate are elected for four-year terms.  The participation of women / MPs / Senators in the parliament (as of the beginning of the term) in 2011 corresponds to the 7th term of the Sejm and the 8th term of the Senate (from November 8, 2011 to November 11, 2015), in 2015 to the 8th term of the Sejm and the 9th term of the Senate (from November 12, 2015 to November 11, 2019) and in 2019 to the 9th term of the Sejm and the 10th term of the Senate (from November 12, 2019).  The legislative bodies (i.e constituting) of local government units include gmina council, powiat council and voivodship regional council. The gmina council is a constituting and controlling body in the gmina. Since 2018, members of these bodies (councilors) are elected for a five-year term (in the years 1990-2018, the term of office lasted 4 years). Pursuant to the Act of September 29, 2022 on the extension of the term of office of local government units (Journal of Laws of 2022, item 2418), the term of office of the authorities expiring in 2023 was extended once until April 30, 2024.  The executive authority in rural gminas is exercised by a village mayor. The mayor is the executive body of the gmina where the seat of the authorities is located in a city located on the territory of the gmina. In cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, the executive body is the president of the city. This also applies to cities in which, until the entry into force of the Act of 8 March 1990 on Local Self-Government, the president of the city was the executive and managing body.",

Water supply is a composite of engineering equipment and technical objects, whose task is to provide the population and industry in the water of the required quantities and properties corresponding to its destination. Requirements for the quality of water intended for human consumption, including bacteriological, physico-chemical and organoleptic characteristics determines the regulation of the Minister of Health of 13 November 2015 on the quality of water intended for human consumption (Journal of Laws of 2015, item 1989). Data on urban population connected to water supply and sewage systems comprise the population inhabiting residential buildings connected to a particular network. Due to a change in the estimation method, data from 2014, are not fully comparable with the data presented in previous years. The starting point for data estimation are the results of the National Census of Population and Housing. The data is then corrected by adding information on change of the number of completed buildings and the number of dwellings per one building (based on reports on residential buildings and dwellings in non-residential buildings completed and reports on losses of dwelling stock). The indicator of the number of persons per one dwelling comes from the balance of dwelling stocks. This is the number of actually residing population, as of December 31 in a given year, divided by the number of dwellings. Information on the newly connected or disconnected buildings is derived from the report on water supply system, sewage system and liquid waste stored in septic tanks.",

In principle, the ideal situation happens when the indicator value equals 100, but it can be attained only under rational and compact building development. When analyzing the indicator, not only the investment opportunities of municipalities (gminas) should be taken into account, but also the natural conditions and the nature of the building development, resulting in lower indicator values in rural areas and areas with varied landscaping. The starting point for data estimation are the results of the National Census of Population and Housing. The data is then corrected by adding information on change of the number of completed buildings and the number of dwellings per one building (based on reports on residential buildings and dwellings in non-residential buildings completed and reports on losses of dwelling stock). The indicator of the number of persons per one dwelling comes from the balance of dwelling stocks. This is the number of actually residing population, as of December 31 in a given year, divided by the number of dwellings. Information on the newly connected or disconnected buildings is derived from the report on water supply system, sewage system and liquid waste stored in septic tanks. Data on the population connected to water supply and sewage system since 2014, due to a change of the estimation method, are not fully comparable with the data presented for previous years. According to the Law of 7 June 2001 on the public water supply and sewage collection, an active sewerage network is a system of covered canals (underground) discharging sewage from buildings and other objects to collectors or waste water treatment facilities.",

The types and amount of pollutants in industrial wastewater are very diverse. They depend on the type of industry, type of raw materials used in production and the production technology used. In statistics, the industrial wastewater also include cooling water, polluted and saline waters from mine drainage and sewage works as well as social and living wastewaters related to manufacturing processes.  Data on industrial wastewater refer to sewage discharged by the entities, which according to Polish Classification of Activity were included under 'Industry' covering ”Mining and quarrying”, ”Manufacturing”, ”Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply” and “Water supply sewerage, waste management and remediation activities” as well as other sections, whose share in the volume of discharged sewage is insignificant. Industrial wastewater requiring treatment means sewage discharged via a network of open canals or ditches directly to waters, ground or sewage network from production entities (including water contaminated as a result of dehydration of mines and contaminated waters used in industry for cooling). Municipal wastewater means domestic wastewater or mixture of domestic wastewater with industrial sewage and rainwater disposed of by a commune through sewage water system and wastewater treatment plants.Data on municipal wastewaters cover sewage discharged via a sewage network by the units managed by water supply and sewage companies and plants established by a voivode (or managed by territorial self-local governments) and from 1994 all units supervising collective discharge of sewage via sewage network (including housing cooperatives, water companies, water service plants, enterprises etc.) Prior to discharge to the recipient, all the sewage should be treated. Thus, in the statistics, the wastewater means wastewater requiring treatment. The data do not include precipitation and infiltration water discharged via sewage network. Wastewater treated is wastewater subjected to the process of adjusting to environmental standards or other quality standards. Three methods are distinguished: mechanical, chemical and biological processes or increased biogene removal (including chemical). For the purpose of calculating the total amount of treated wastewater, only the amount which was subjected to the highest mentioned biogene removal is presented. Therefore, wastewater treated mechanically and biologically should be reported as wastewater treated biologically and the wastewater treated using all methods should be reported as treated using increased biogene removal method. Wastewater requiring treatment is wastewater which prior to discharge to the recipient, should undergo treatment processes.",

The worst indicator decides about final assessment. Classification of the uniform water bodies to the moderate or worse ecological status/potential, or to the bad chemical status, shows the bad status of waters, what informs that during evaluated period the uniform water body did not comply the assigned requirements of environmental goals. When the result of assessment showed at least good ecological status/potential, but the chemical status was not assessed or chemical status was good, but it was impossible to classify the ecological status/potential, it was impossible to define the final assessment of the status of uniform water bodies. The assessment of monitored uniform rivers and lakes water bodies was completed with extrapolation or expert assessment of the rest of waters. In the accepted method, when there was no data for precised classification of the ecological status/potential, “at least good” or “below good” classification was assigned, what enabled to define the final assessment of the status. Due to the cyclical planning and programming in water management in Poland, data on the quality of surface waters for: • 2015 refer to the cycle covering the years 2010-2015 for  lakes and rivers (lakes studied in 9 voivodeships, and rivers throughout the country), • 2021 refer to the cycle covering the years 2016-2021 for lakes and rivers (lakes studied in 10 voivodships, and rivers throughout the country).  A significant reduction in the percentage of water bodies with good water quality in 2021 compared to 2015 results from the inclusion of priority substances in water monitoring that were not previously monitored. In addition, in 2016, the regulation on the method of classifying the status of surface water bodies and environmental quality standards for priority substances was amended, in which the requirements for physicochemical elements were tightened.",

Mine water and drainage water as well as water abstractions from precipitation are included, whereas water used for hydroelectricity generation (in situ use) is excluded. For the calculation of water productivity Eurostat uses the GDP either in the unit of EUR in chain-linked volumes to the reference year 2010 at 2010 exchange rates or in the unit PPS (Purchasing Power Standard). The unit EUR in chain linked volumes allows observing the water productivity trends over time in a single geographic area, whereas the unit PPS allows to compare countries for the same year.

Poland acceded to the convention on 22 march 1978 The convention's mission is the conservation and wise use of all wetlands through local and national actions and international cooperation, as a contribution towards achieving sustainable development accross the world. According to the Ramsar Convention wetlands are '...areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres'. The Ramsar Contracting Parties, including Poland, have committed themselves to designate suitable wetlands for the List of Wetlands of International Importance, work towards the wise use of all their wetlands through national land-use planning, appropriate policies and legislation, management actions, and public education and to cooperate internationally in the implementation of the convention. There are 13 Ramsar Sites on the List of Wetlands of International Importance, in Poland:  Biebrzanaki National Park (59 233 ha, since 1995) Slowinski National Park (32 744 ha, since 1995) Wigry National Park (15 085 ha, since 2002) Poleski National Park (9 764 ha, since 2002) Narew River National Park (7 350 ha, since 2002) Milicz Fishponds Nature Reserve (5 324 ha, since 1995) Warta River Mouth National Park (8 074 ha, since 1984) Druzno Lake Nature Reserve (3 068 ha, since 2002) Lake of Seven Islands Nature Reserve (1 618 ha, since 1984) Luknajno Lake Nature Reserve (1 189 ha, since 1977) Swidwie Lake Nature Reserve (891 ha, since 1984) Karas Lake Nature Reserve (815 ha, since 1984) Subalpine peatbogs in Karkonosze Mountains (40 ha, since 2002) ",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least: 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9 %), 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2021” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. The water and sanitation sector includes support areas classified as subsector 31140 and sector 140 according to the OECD methodology (more information at: Aid to the Water and Sanitation sector)",

Clean fuel is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion. The indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices comes from about 1300 nationally representative survey and censuses. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), and other nationally developed and implemented surveys. Estimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a given country and year are obtained together using a single multivariate hierarchical model. Using household survey data as inputs, the model jointly estimates primary reliance on 6 specific fuel types:  ∙ unprocessed biomass (e.g. wood),   ∙ charcoal,   ∙ coal,   ∙ kerosene,   ∙ gaseous fuels (e.g. LPG),   ∙ electricity;   and a final category including other clean fuels (e.g. alcohol).",

Gross domestic consumption of energy presents the amount of energy required to meet domestic consumption of a geographical unit and is calculated as follows: the acquisition of primary energy + fuel recovery + import + change in inventories - export - 'bunker'. Gross domestic energy consumption includes consumption of coal, electricity, crude oil, natural gas and renewable energy. Kgoe stands for kilogram of oil equivalent (contractual), which is a unit of measurement of energy used in international balance sheets. It indicates the amount of energy that can be produced from the combustion of one metric kilogram of crude oil. One tonne of oil is equal to the contractual 41.868 GJ or 11.63 MWh.",

                                          "methodology": "Official Development Assistance (ODA) comprises grants and loans that are provided by government agencies or international organizations to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies.",

The grant element is calculated specifically for tied aid credits. Additionally, work is underway to include other flows in ODA, e.g. amounts mobilized by the public sector from private sector instruments. Moreover, since 2019, Poland has been reporting a new TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) indicator, which measures the support provided for the implementation of the SDGs at the global level. The presented indicator (7.a.1 Official Development Assistance for climate change mitigation and adaptation) in the total number of heads of agricultural holding) is a proxy indicator to the one adopted in the official list of indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The replacement of the original indicator (7.a.1 International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon.",

Locality and address sampling was carried out via Statistics Poland's central catalogue of streets (ULIC), being part of the system of the address identification of streets, real properties, buildings and dwellings (NOBC) (https://bip.stat.gov.pl/dzialalnosc-statystyki-publicznej/rejestr-teryt/zakres-rejestru-teryt/).",

The module survey is an additional survey implemented at the same time as the basic survey allowing to extend the scope of information obtained in the basic survey. Since 2017, the observation period of the modular survey 'Unregistered employment in Poland' has covered 12 months of the year (previous editions of the survey covered a period of 9 months, i.e. months from January to September). The extension of the observation period made it possible to assess the scale of the phenomenon throughout the year. Due to the change introduced, the comparability of the time series of data prior to 2017 is limited. In addition, the lack of comparability of the time series for data from 2022 onwards is also affected by methodological changes concerning the definition of the employed person introduced in the basic LFS from Q1 2021. (data on employed persons are used in the denominator when calculating the indicator). Unregistered unemployment is defined as: - employment performed without employment relationship, that is, without a contract, order-agreement, contract for a particular task/work or any other written agreement between the employer and employee, regardless of the ownership sector (also in private households and in private farms) unregistered work cannot be performed on the basis of call, appointment, or election performing unregistered work does not entitle the employee to social security and, by implication, to the right to social benefits the duration of that work is not counted as contribution from the viewpoint of Social Insurance Institution the employer does not allot contribution from the employee's wages and salaries to Social Insurance Institution and Labour Found income taxes are not deducted from income generated through unregistered employment, - self-employment if the concluded economic activity does not meet financial obligations to the state (e.g. taxes).  The employed from 2021 onwards, according to the LFS definition, include all persons aged 15-89 years (previously it was persons aged 15 years and over) who during the survey week: - have been engaged for at least 1 hour in work that generates earnings or income, i.e. have been employed by a public company/institution or private employer, have worked on their own (or leased) farm or have been self-employed outside agriculture, have assisted (without remuneration) in running a family farm or a family business outside agriculture, - had work but did not perform it due to:  • due to illness, or leave of absence, parental leave (maternity, parental, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (working arrangements or receipt of overtime), job-related training, • due to the seasonal nature of the work, if they continued to regularly fulfil work or business-related tasks and duties (excluding legal or administrative duties) during the off-season, • for other reasons, if the expected period of absence from work does not exceed 3 months. In accordance with the international standards, among the employed, there are also included apprentices who entered into occupational training or occupational preparation contract with a private or public employer if they received remuneration.",

Outside the scope of the survey are members of households staying (the total duration of actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as staff hotels, dormitories, boarding schools, nursing homes, etc.) and homeless people. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and ecomically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. The employed are defined as all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week: 1. performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed by a public company/institution or private employer,, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in work on family agricultural farm or in conducting family economic activity outside agriculture, 2. had work but did not perform it due to: • sickness, or rest leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, parental, paternity or childcare), organization of working time (work system or overtime receipt), job-related training, • the seasonal nature of the work, if they continued to regularly fulfill work or business-related tasks and duties (excluding legal or administrative duties) during the off-season, • other reasons, if the expected period of absence from work does not exceed 3 months - did not exceed 3 months. In accordance with the international standards, among the employed, there are also included apprentices who entered into occupational training or occupational preparation contract with a private or public employer if they received remuneration. The employed do not include: volunteers and unpaid interns, people working in individual agriculture engaged in the production of agricultural products exclusively or primarily for their own consumption. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 who simultaneously fulfil three conditions: • within the reference week were not employed, • were actively looking for work, i.e. for over 4 weeks (the reference week being the fourth one) had been involved in concrete actions aimed at finding a job, • were available to take up work within two weeks after the reference week. Persons who were not seeking work because they had already found a job, were only waiting to start work within the period no longer than 3 months, and were available for this job are also included in the category of the unemployed.",

Information from these sources is coded according to 108 evaluation criteria representing different types of FACB rights violations, such as: 1. Violations of fundamental civil liberties. 2. Workers’ right to establish and join organizations. 3. Rights concerning the internal functioning of these organizations. 4. Rights to collective bargaining. 5. The right to strike. These categories are themselves split into violations of FACB rights in law and in practice:  • violations in law refer to national legislation that is not in conformity with FACB rights as defined by the ILO as well as to actions taken on the basis of such legislation,  • violations in practice refer to acts committed and in violation of the existing national legislation that is in conformity with FACB rights as defined by the ILO. Overall violations are the sum of violations in law and in practice.

ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost. No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA. Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients. Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, multilateral assistance which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat. Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies. The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2021” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania. Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with sustainable development goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other ministries.",

Therefore, the indicator did not cover expenditures within multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to the general budgets of organisations also working in the trade area. Since 2018, the indicator has been presented as a grant equivalent including only the grant element multiplied by the value of a given flow. As a result, there is no differentiation into net and gross ODA. Additionally, some methodological activities are being conducted to incorporate other flows into ODA, such as mobilised amount of money by the public sector from the private sector instruments. Furthermore, an alternative to ODA, TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) is being developed as an instrument for measuring means for SDGs implementation.  In 2021, only trade sectors are included. The trade support marker, that has been withdrawn as part of the ODA statistical reporting, is not included.",

Presented work may also contain the results of research being in the development phase. Moreover, this research has been conducted in an innovative way using experimental methods and a new methodological approach. The results of the experimental statistics are not official statistics.The indicator was calculated by Statistical Office in Olsztyn basing on the methodology proposed by the United Nations using data from three databases: two databases maintained by Head Office of Land Surveying and Cartography (GUGiK) (the BDOT10k and PRG databases) as well as the WorldPop database.The Topographic Objects Database (BDOT10k) is a vector database containing the spatial location of topographic features along with a basic description of their properties. The content and detail level of the BDOT10k database generally corresponds to a traditional topographic map at the scale of 1:10,000. Database contains information on road type and category, road surface type, as well as road width and length.The National Register of Boundaries (PRG) is an official reference database providing  the basis for other spatial information systems and using data concerning administrative units of the country. The PRG covers the area of the whole country and contains information about boundaries and areas of the fundamental three-level administrative division of the country (i.e. gminas, powiats, and voivodships), registration units, registration precincts, special borders, as well as addresses and their spatial location.The WorldPop database contains high-resolution global data on the distribution of the human population in the form of a 100x100m raster. The datasets provide an estimate of the number of people living in each grid cell.In order to calculate the index, the following steps were carried out: 1. Exclusion of the city areas and designation of a mask for rural areas analysis based on data from the PRG database. 2. Designation of the roads from the BDOT10k database that meet the 'all-season road' condition, with the exception of city areas. 3. Designation of a road buffer with a radius of 2 kilometres. 4. Calculation of population within the buffer limits based on WorldPop database data and total population for rural areas. 5. Calculation of the indicator.",

Road transport of passengers  Road transport of passengers is the total number of passengers carried by scheduled daytime services (according to timetable), special scheduled services (e.g. carriage of employees, to school) and other carriage (e.g. holiday trips) in national and international transport. Data on road transport of passengers do not include transport of persons by buses: of urban public transport enterprises, enterprises carrying out tourist services and transport of persons by buses on own account. The data do not include transport services carried out by entities employing fewer than 9 persons. Air transport of passengers Data concerning air transport of passengers include passengers carried on scheduled flights, additional and rented (chartered), by aircrafts owned by Polish operators in scheduled air transport (transport of passengers on permanent routes and according to permanent flight schedules) as well as other Polish operators providing such services against payment in international and national transport. Maritime transport of goods Cargo transport in cruises finished with merchant ships, own ferries and ships and ferries hired from other ship-owners. It covers cargo transport in all directions, i.e., cargo delivered into Polish ports from foreign ports, from Polish ports into foreign ports, between foreign ports, between Polish ports. It does not cover transport of goods by ships and ferries chartered to foreign ship-owners. Data on the maritime transport fleet concern ships of the Polish property, joint ownership or share, whatever flag they hoist. The ships of the Polish maritime fleet include ships which are owned by Polish maritime transport enterprises, ships rented from a ship-owner company, whose shareholders are Polish enterprises, and ships owned by companies (with a share of Polish capital) with their seat abroad, which are operated by Polish enterprises. Transport by inland waterway fleet  Data concerning transport by inland waterway fleet refer to the fleet operated by Polish inland waterway transport enterprises (including vessels which are at the disposal of foreign enterprises during the period of navigation break on Polish inland waterway) and, since 2001, also entities whose main activity is different than providing these services. The data concerning carriage of goods by inland waterways do not include small consignments carried by passenger vessels. Air transport of goods  Data concerning air transport of goods include freight and passengers carried on scheduled flights, additional and rented (chartered), by aircrafts owned by Polish operators in scheduled air transport (transport of goods on permanent routes and according to permanent flight schedules) as well as other Polish operators providing such services against payment in international and national transport.   Railway transport of goods  Data on railway transport of goods include the sum of the gross weight of all commercial and official consignments (i.e. together with the weight of the packages, and in the case of transport in containers together with the weight of the containers) transported in wagons in national and international transport by all types of trains. The data do not cover shunting.   Road transport of goods  Data concerning road transport of goods refer to total road transport, i.e. both for hire or reward and on own account, in public and private sectors. Road transport for hire or reward is understood as providing paid transport services whereas road transport on own account as carriage of goods on own needs, i.e. without payment (calculated into the costs of a business enterprise). In part, these are estimated data.  Pipeline transport of goods  Data on the pipeline transport of goods include crude oil and crude oil products pumped through major pipelines for the domestic demand (including imported) and by transit through the territory of Poland. The amount of crude oil (crude oil products) is the sum of net weights of individual lots of crude oil (products) received to client's tanks upon delivery-acceptance protocols.

Researchers (i.e. professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems and also in the management of the projects) constitute the most numerous group of R&D personnel.The group ‘pracownicy naukowo-badawczy’ is a Polish equivalent of the researchers group (presented in Frascati Manual), also named as ‘scientists and engineers’. Belonging into this group requires neither formal qualifications nor occupying a specific post. Full-time equivalents (FTE) are conversion units used to determine actual employment in R&D . One full-time equivalent (FTE) means one person-year devoted exclusively to R&D activities. Employment in R&D in full-time equivalents is calculated on the basis of the ratio of working time devoted to R&D by particular employees within a reporting year to full working time on a particulate position in a given institution. Full-time equivalent is the only measure of employment in R&D used in international comparisons and international publications issued by OECD and EUROSTAT.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. ODA Sector 2. Economic Infrastructure and Services covers assistance for networks, utilities and services that facilitate economic activity. It includes, but is not exhausted by: Energy: production and distribution of energy, including peaceful use of nuclear energy; Transportation and Communications: essentially equipment or infrastructure for road, rail, water and air transport, and for television, radio and electronic information networks.",

EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Equivalent disposable income in the survey is defined as a sum of the net (after deduction of income tax prepayment, tax on income from property, social and health insurance contributions) annual monetary incomes gained by all the household members reduced by:  property tax, inter-household cash transfers paid and balance of offsetting settlements with the Tax Office.  For the calculation of income statistics the modified OECD equivalence scale was applied which is calculated as follows:  1 for the first adult household member, 0.5 for the second and each subsequent household member aged 14 and over, 0.3 for every child in the household under 14.  And thus, for instance, the extreme and relative poverty threshold for a 4-person household consisting of two adult persons and two children is 2,1 times as high as that for a 1-person household. A household is classified into a given quintile groups on the basis of per capita available income in that household. Thus members of all the households in the survey are listed according to the increasing per capita available income using the weights applied in the survey and divided into five groups, equal in number of the weighted persons. The first quintile (I) consists of 20% of persons with the lowest incomes, while the fifth quintile (V) 20% of persons with the highest incomes.",

In a survey carried out in 2015, respondents were asked: 'Would you consider to be a person belonging to a social group that for any reason is treated less favourably (discriminated) than other groups in Poland?' Possible answers were: yes or no. The aim of the social cohesion survey is to gather information allowing a comprehensive assessment of the quality of life (considering economic and social aspects), evaluated from the perspective of both objective and subjective indicators. Owing to the integration of individual data, it is possible to determine i.e. in which groups of the society there is an accumulation of favourable or unfavourable aspects of the quality of life, which factors determine these situations, and which relationships exist between various dimensions of the quality of life. A wide range of collected information enable e.g. to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the level and diversity of lifestyles as well as a multidimensional analysis of poverty, social exclusion, social capital and subjective well-being.",

This set includes the following indicators: 1. Regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (CAR) - the ratio of regulatory capital to the value of risk-weighted assets. The regulatory capital of an institution as defined in accordance with the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (Capital Requirements Regulation-CRR) is the sum of its Tier 1 capital (capital used to cover losses under solvency conditions of a bank this capital allows the bank to continue normal operations and provide liquidity to the bank) and Tier II capital (capital used to cover losses in the condition of loss of solvency of a bank allows the bank to pay off depositors and privileged creditors when the bank ceases to be solvent). Capital requirements expressed in terms of the amount of bank exposure per particular risk, including credit risk. 2. Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets - expressed as percentage a relation of regulatory Tier I capital to the value of risk-weighted assets. The regulatory Tier I capital as defined in in accordance with Capital Requirements Regulation CRR consists of Tier 1 capital and supplementary Tier I capital. Capital requirements expressed in terms of the amount of bank exposure per particular risk, including credit risk. 3. Nonperforming loans net of provisions to capital -the ratio of the value of nonperforming loans overdue by more than 90 days to the value of regulatory capital. Nonperforming loans in the case of banks using IAS are classified as impaired loans, and in the case of banks applying PAS - substandard, doubtful and lost. 4. Nonperforming loans to total gross loans - the ratio of the value of nonperforming loans overdue by more than 90 days to the total gross value of credits, including nonimpaired and impaired credits. Gross credits are not reduced by the value of write-offs/reserves.5. Sectoral distribution of loans to total loans: residents - the ratio of value of gross loans granted to individual sectors of the economy to total gross loans Total gross loans include both impaired and nonimpaired loans, and they are not reduced by the value of write-offs/reserves. 6. Return on assets (ROA) - expressed in percentage a relation of the net financial result in the period of 12 months preceding the balance sheet date to the average asset size in that period. 7. Return on equity (ROE) - the ratio of the net financial result in the period of 12 months preceding the balance sheet date to average amount of Tier 1 regulatory capital in that period. 8. Interest margin / Net interest income to gross income - the ratio of value of the difference between interest income earned by the bank and interest expenses paid by the bank to the gross income (which is the sum of net interest income from fees and commisions, result of valuation trading activity, income from dividends and other operating income) in the period of 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. 9. Noninterest expenses to gross income - the ratio of all cost items of banks except for interest expenses to gross income in the period of 12 months preceding the balance sheet date. 10. Liquid assets to total assets (liquid asset ratio) - the ratio of the value of assets, which may be, without excessive loss, converted into cash to total assets. Liquid assets according to the broad measure defined in the IMF handbook include: cash in hand, operations with central bank (current account nostro, one-day deposits), current accounts - financial sector (banks), debt securities held for trading (central banks, central government institutions) debt instruments for sale (central banks, central government institutions) and debt instruments measured at fair value with the result of valuation related to the profit or loss account (central banks, central government institutions).Assets - material resources controlled by an entity of credibly specified value, obtained as aresult of past events and which will bring economic benefits to the entity. There are financial assets (including but not limited to cash, credits, securities) and nonfinancial ((including but not limited to fixed assets). 11. Liquid assets to short-term liabilities - the value of liquid assets in relation to total liabilities with maturity up to 1 year from the balance sheet date. 12. Net open position in foreign exchange to capital.- the ration of the value of net open foreign currency position to regulatory Tier I capital. Open foreign currency position (net) is a difference of long and short position in foreign currencies resulting form possessed financial instruments (assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items). Long position means profit form foreign currency appreciation and loss from foreign currency depreciation (short position - vice versa). Capital requirements, total regulatory capital and regulatory Tier 1 capital have been used to calculate indicators since the first quarter of 2014. Determined in accordance with the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council No. 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation-CRR). In the period from March 2010 to December 2013 the data in terms of capital adequacy, including own funds, were established by banks in accordance with the provisions of Article 127 of Banking Law, Resolution of Financing Supervision Committee No. 76/2010 and No. 381/2008. Polish Accounting Standards (PAS) - national accounting rules laid down in the Act of 29 September 1994 on accounting (uniform text from 2013. Item 330, as amended) and the implementing legislation to the law and the accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards Committee.International Accounting Standards (IAS) - International Accounting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and related interpretations published in the form of regulations of the European Commission. In accordance with the methodology for compilation financial soundness indicators (FSI) amended by the International Monetary Fund, from 2021 onwards, the indicator 'Sector concentration of loans to total loans to residents' has been replaced by the indicator 'Loan concentration by economic activity', defined as “The lending to the largest three economic activities, as a proportion of their total gross loans to nonfinancial corporations”.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. Foreign direct investment is, in another way, capital flows across national borders involving the purchase of an existing enterprise or creation of a new company by a foreign investor, which means that the foreign investor becomes a co-owner or owner of the enterprise operating in the given country.Foreign direct investment is a longterm cooperation, which is a reflection of the lasting interest of the investor. Investments are financial assets, real estates or intangible fixed assets, which are not used by the given unit, but have been acquired in order to achieve economic benefits. They mean the expenses incurred for increasing the stock of productive capital, which unit has. Direct investment reflects long-term investment of an organization owned by a resident of one economy (direct investor) in an organization owned by a resident of other economy (direct investment company) and includes transactions between the two.

Presented work may also contain the results of research being in the development phase. Moreover, this research has been conducted in an innovative way using experimental methods and a new methodological approach. The results of the experimental statistics are not official statistics.The indicator was calculated by Statistical Office in Olsztyn basing on the methodology proposed by the United Nations using data from three sources: Sentinel satellite data, PRG database maintained by Head Office of Land Surveying and Cartography (GUGiK), as well as the WorldPop database.Sentinel satellite data - radiometric data (Sentinel 1 GRD) and optical data (Sentinel 2) with 10 m spatial resolution.The National Register of Boundaries (PRG) is an official reference database providing  the basis for other spatial information systems and using data concerning administrative units of the country. The PRG covers the area of the whole country and contains information about boundaries and areas of the fundamental three-level administrative division of the country (i.e. gminas, powiats, and voivodships), registration units, registration precincts, special borders, as well as addresses and their spatial location. The WorldPop database contains high-resolution global data on the distribution of the human population in the form of a 100x100 m raster. The datasets provide an estimate of the number of people living in each grid cell.In order to calculate the index, the following steps were carried out: 1. Determining the administrative borders of cities from the PRG database. 2. Designating a buffer with a radius of 2 km from the city limits (the growth of urbanized areas is mainly at the expense of rural gminas bordering cities). 3. Excluding underwater and arable land from the analysis (to increase the precision of the classification of built-up areas using satellite data). 4. Development of cloudless mosaics of radar and optical data and their masking to the analysed areas of cities and adjacent areas. 5. Determination of radiometric indicators for Sentinel-2 (NDVI, NBI, SAVI, BSI) and Sentinel-1 data (sigma nought in vertical polarization). 6. Execution of object based image classification and development of maps of urbanized areas, and calculation of their area for 2015 and 2020. 7. Development of a script automating calculations in the Google Earth Engine environment. 8. Calculating the number of people in the analysed area for the indicator for 2015 and 2020.",

                                          "methodology": "The indicator was calculated as a result of the experimental statistics research work answering the needs connected to the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals of 2030 Agenda.Experimental statistics is a type of research exceeding the standard practice of official statistics, which can cover the identified information gaps. Presented work may also contain the results of research being in the development phase. Moreover, this research has been conducted in an innovative way using experimental methods and a new methodological approach. The results of the experimental statistics are not official statistics.The indicator was calculated by Statistical Office in Olsztyn using data from five sources, basing on the methodology proposed by the United Nations: Sentinel satellite data, the BDOT10k and PRG databases maintained by Head Office of Land Surveying and Cartography (GUGiK), the WorldPop database and OpenStreetMap.Sentinel satellite data - radiometric data (Sentinel 1 GRD) and optical data (Sentinel 2) with 10 m spatial resolution.The Topographic Objects Database (BDOT10k) is a vector database containing the spatial location of topographic features along with a basic description of their properties. The content and detail level of the BDOT10k database generally corresponds to a traditional topographic map at the scale of 1:10,000. Database contains information on: road type and category, road surface type, as well as road width and length.The National Register of Boundaries (PRG) is an official reference database providing  the basis for other spatial information systems and using data concerning administrative units of the country. The PRG covers the area of the whole country and contains information about boundaries and areas of the fundamental three-level administrative division of the country (i.e. gminas, powiats, and voivodships), registration units, registration precincts, special borders, as well as addresses and their spatial location. The WorldPop database contains high-resolution global data on the distribution of the human population in the form of a 100x100m raster. The datasets provide an estimate of the number of people living in each grid cell.OpenStreetMap database is a community project aimed at creating a free, openly available map of the entire globe, editable by registered users. Data and maps based on the database are being published on the Open Database License.In order to calculate the index, the following steps were carried out: 1. Determining the administrative borders of cities from the PRG database. 2. Designating open spaces for public use for all within city limits (parks, squares, forests, playgrounds, other recreational areas) from OpenStreetMap database. 3. Determining the areas of land under the roads basing on BDOT10k database. 4. The built-up areas within city limits were determined with the use of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite data (methodology similar to that used for indicator 11.3.1): * Excluding underwater and arable land from the analysis (to increase the precision of the classification of built-up areas using satellite data), * Determination of radiometric indicators for Sentinel-2 (NDVI, NBI, SAVI, BSI) and Sentinel-1 data (sigma nought in vertical polarization), * Development of cloudless mosaics of radar data and optical data and their masking to the analysed areas of cities and adjacent areas, * Execution of object classification and development of maps of urbanized areas, and calculation of their area. 5. Calculating the indicators of open public spaces for public use for all in cities in general, by age and gender groups: * The geometry of the polygons of public spaces within the city limits was simplified using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm, the number of polygon vertices was reduced, and then the vertices of these polygons were separated, * Creating 100-meter buffers around the roads (assuming that the entry point to the OPS cannot be too far from the road), * Selecting the tops of the polygons located in a 100 m buffer from the roads (in order to designate entry points for large objects such as forests), * Designating the roads for which the pedestrian route to the OPS entrance is no longer than 400 m, * Designating a 100 m buffer for the routes to reach the OPS, * Calculating the indicator of the availability of open public spaces up to 400 m by gender and age.",

The priorities of the program are: 1. Understanding the risks associated with disasters. 2. Strengthening of disaster risk management to enable its management. 3. Investing in disaster risk reduction to strengthen resilience. 4. Improving the system of preparedness to respond effectively to disasters and 'better rehabilitation' for recovery, repair and reconstruction. National disaster risk reduction strategy, including natural disasters, in line with the Sendai Framework is a part of the Report on Threats to National Security. This report is updated periodically. Updates took place in 2015, 2018 and 2021. The main goals of the strategy are to reduce existing and future threats by performing risk assessment, alerting and building disaster resilience. Local disaster risk reduction strategies – voivodship’s partial reports for Report on Threats to National Security, compliant with national risk reduction strategy, are periodically updated and are one of the bases for developing Report on Threats to National Security. The main aim of these strategies is including local initiatives into the actions for disaster risk reduction (both natural and caused by the intentional human activity).",

The signatories provide an example of active involvement and responsible implementation of the principles of sustainable development within the organisation, providing a valuable source of inspiration for others. The cooperation of a wide group of stakeholders reflects Poland's efforts to actively involve public and private entities, non-governmental organizations, the science sector and civil society in the planning and implementation of development activities. This is to ensure wider communication, increase awareness of the need for cooperation and dialogue. The signatories join the Partnership during conference events organized by the national coordinator of implementing SDGs in Poland – the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology (until January 2018 – the Ministry of Economic Development). During the ceremony of joining the Partnership, the Signatories on one common Partnership Card, successively sign the following declarations: “Aware of global economic, social and environmental challenges and their complexity, we see sustainable development as an opportunity to create a new economic reality, opening new paths of development for business, based on the principles of transparency and building the image of Poland as a reliable economic partner. We recognise that ambitious goals and targets will be achieved through working together in an effective manner, mobilising forces, creating synergies, a lively and strengthened partnership, the result of dialogue that is open to all stakeholders. In an effort to jointly exploit opportunities for change in the country, region and enterprise, to increase the impact on sustainable development, we express our intention to cooperate within the framework of this partnership initiative for the achievement of the SDGs.”",

This document also specifies the actions the objective of which was to propagate social themes of public procurement.

This is the first Polish strategy document, which directly relates to the issue of adaptation to climate change. The aim of the NAS 2020 is to provide sustainable development and the effective functioning of the economy and society in the face of the risks posed by climate changes. The document indicated the priority directions of adaptation actions that should be taken by 2020 in the most sensitive to climate change areas:  • water management,  • agriculture,  • forestry,  • biodiversity,  • health,  • energy,  • construction and spatial planning,  • urban areas,  • transport,  • mountain areas and coastal zones. NAS 2020 is part of a wider research project called KLIMADA, carried out (in years 2011-2013) on the request of the Ministry of the Environment with funds from the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management, covering the period up to 2070. NAS 2020 strategy is part of the activities of the European Union in terms of adaptation to climate change, which aims to improve the immunity of the Member States on the current and expected climate change, with a focus on better preparation for extreme climatic and weather conditions and the socio-economic costs reduction. Together with the strategy adopted by the Council of Ministers, the special website klimada.mos.gov.pl was launched. It contains information about mitigation and adaptation to climate change.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies.",

The grant element is calculated specifically for tied aid credits. Additionally, work is underway to include other flows in ODA, e.g. amounts mobilized by the public sector from private sector instruments. Moreover, since 2019, Poland has been reporting a new TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) indicator, which measures the support provided for the implementation of the SDGs at the global level. The presented indicator (13.a.1 Official Development Assistance for climate change mitigation and adaptation) is a proxy indicator to the one adopted in the official list of indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The replacement of the original indicator (13.a.1 Amounts provided and mobilized in United States dollars per year in relation to the continued existing collective mobilization goal of the $100 billion commitment through to 2025) is due to the inability to obtain data for it. The proxy indicator has been selected so as to most fully reflect the essence of the observed phenomenon.",

Maximum Sustainable Yield is understood as the largest catch that can be taken from fish stocks for an period. The aim of this threshold is to achieve maximum efficiency of fish stocks while maintaining biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems relevant to present and future generations. Fish stocks are considered to be sustainable if their numbers persist at a level that ensures maximum sustainable yield or higher. In order to ensure that basic industrial species in the Baltic Sea are operated at a renewable level, Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 has been drawn up and adopted establishing a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks (amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007). This regulation specifies the maximum level of fishing (maximum sustainable yield) of the species in question by imposing conservation obligations, including maintaining or restoring populations of target species at renewable levels. The indicator adopts four dimensions, i.e .:1. proportion of fully exploited fish stocks2. proportion of fish stocks not fully exploited3. proportion of fish stocks over-exploited) and4. proportion of stocks within sustainable biological limit Sustainable levels include those fish stocks which, according to the stock assessment, were classified as 'not fully exploited' and 'fully exploited'. The indicator is calculated as the sum of these two categories divided by the total number of fish species subject to resource assessment and multiplied by 100. The assessment of stocks includes fish stocks as defined in Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council for which a multi-annual plan has been established:1. Atlantic cod in the western part of the Baltic Sea2. Atlantic cod in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea3. Atlantic herring in the western part of the Baltic Sea4.

A new instrument of international law, implementing the third objective of the Convention on Biological Diversity (on the right of countries to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies) is The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization. It was adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the Convention at its tenth meeting in 2010. After the entry into force of the Nagoya Protocol, which occurred on 12 October 2014, all entities that obtain their genetic resources originating from countries that have ratified the Protocol, are obliged to respect the provisions of the Protocol and instruments implementing it. Poland signed the Nagoya Protocol on 20 September 2011 and is currently in the process of its ratification. The Nagoya Protocol applies to access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use. Aims to establish a system requiring users of genetic resources to share with donor resources benefits arising as a result of their use. The Nagoya Protocol applies both to genetic resources of organisms occurring in the wild, and used in the economy (with the exception of human genetic resources). Affect the functioning of the donors and recipients of genetic resources, including among others: botanical and zoological gardens, gene banks, the agricultural sector (animal husbandry, cultivation of plants, seed production, feed production), horticulture, forestry, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, biotechnology, food processing, and even industries with the production of fuels and plastics. In the European Union obligations of the users of genetic resources in all the Member States is governed by a Regulation (EU) No 511/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on compliance measures for users from the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization in the Union. The task and the jurisdiction of the public authorities in the exercise of the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 511/2014, the rules and general principle concerning mechanism for control of obtaining, possession and utilization of genetic resources and the principle of liability for infringement of the provisions - in Poland is governed by the Law of 19 July 2016, on access to genetic resources and sharing of benefits arising from their utilization (Journal of Laws 2016, item 1340).",

Trade means export, re-export, import and introduction from the sea, whereas re-export means export of any specimen that has previously been imported. Appendix I lists species that are the most endangered or which are or may be subject to commercial activity.Trade in these species should be under particular supervision in order to present further threat to their existence and may be permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Appendix II lists:  • all species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so, unless trade is closely controlled to prevent exploitation which cannot be reconciled with their preservation and  • some specimen, which should be subject to supervision for the purpose of efficient control of trade in species enlisted in Appendix II. Appendix III is a list of species included at the request of a Party that already regulates trade in the species and that needs the cooperation of other countries to prevent unsustainable or illegal exploitation. Total number of CITES speciments for 2010-2015 specifies the number of alive plants and animals.

ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13).

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).

Trade means export, re-export, import and introduction from the sea, whereas re-export means export of any specimen that has previously been imported. Appendix I lists species that are the most endangered or which are or may be subject to commercial activity.Trade in these species should be under particular supervision in order to present further threat to their existence and may be permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Appendix II lists:  • all species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so, unless trade is closely controlled to prevent exploitation which cannot be reconciled with their preservation and  • some specimen, which should be subject to supervision for the purpose of efficient control of trade in species enlisted in Appendix II. Appendix III is a list of species included at the request of a Party that already regulates trade in the species and that needs the cooperation of other countries to prevent unsustainable or illegal exploitation. Total number of CITES speciments for 2010-2015 specifies the number of alive plants and animals.

EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview techniqueusing 2 questionnaires one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Statistics Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Respondents were asked 'How safe do you feel to be alone in your neighborhood after dark?' Possible answers were: very safe, rather safe, rather dangerous, very dangerous, do not go alone after dark, because I feel dangerous, do not go alone after dark for other reasons. To calculate the indicator, the category do not go alone after dark, because I feel dangerous was excluded.",

The birth certificate for the child includes, among others:  • name and surname of the child,  • country, date and place of birth,  • sex,  • surname, first and last names, date and place of birth of the parents of the child. Compiling a Birth certificate for the child allows to give the PESEL number that is necessary for its identification in state registers. Situations when the birth of a child is not reported to the civil status office are treated as crimes, and may involve the case of concealment of the child, i.e. when the birth of a child occurs without the involvement of a medical subject and then the child does not use health services, educational facilities, etc. (what means lack of knowledge of child's existence).",

In a survey carried out in 2015, respondents were asked: 'Would you consider to be a person belonging to a social group that for any reason is treated less favourably (discriminated) than other groups in Poland?' Possible answers were: yes or no. The aim of the social cohesion survey is to gather information allowing a comprehensive assessment of the quality of life (considering economic and social aspects), evaluated from the perspective of both objective and subjective indicators. Owing to the integration of individual data, it is possible to determine i.e. in which groups of the society there is an accumulation of favourable or unfavourable aspects of the quality of life, which factors determine these situations, and which relationships exist between various dimensions of the quality of life. A wide range of collected information enable e.g. to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the level and diversity of lifestyles as well as a multidimensional analysis of poverty, social exclusion, social capital and subjective well-being.",

Gross domestic product (GDP) illustrates the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy (resident producer units - domestic) in a given year.

GDP value can be calculated in three ways:  • from the production side GDP is the sum of value added of all institutional sectors or all sections of the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) of domestic production entities plus taxes less subsidies on products,  • from the distribution side GDP is calculated as the sum of domestic demand, i.e. final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation as well as external balance of goods and services,  • as the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes less subsidies on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy).",

                                          "methodology": "Gross domestic product (GDP) illustrates the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy (resident producer units - domestic) in a given year. The exact definition and methodology for calculating GDP is contained in the regulation of the Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 549/2013 of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010).   Current prices are prices actually used in purchase-sell transactions of goods and services in a given period.   Constant prices result from average current prices in a given year. They allow for a more accurate observation of a given phenomenon through the elimination of the influence of current prices changes.   Gross fixed capital formation is the expenditure which increases the value of tangible fixed assets (buildings and structures, machinery, technical equipment and tools, transport equipment and other fixed assets), excluding expenditure comprising the initial investments as well as interest on investment credits and loans for the period of investment realization. GFC also includes expenditure on:  a) intellectual property products, intended for use for a period longer than 1 year - in particular expenditure on research and development and on computer software (purchased or produced for own final use)  b) small tools that are used in the production longer than 1 year - regardless of their value  c) weapons systems (e.g., tanks, armored vehicles, warships, submarines).    Indices of prices of consumer goods and services are calculated on the basis of observations of prices of selected representative items of consumer goods and services in specific regions of the price survey in Poland. The survey is based on the purposive sampling of representative items. A centrally fixed list of representative items of goods and services remains unchanged and obligatory for all regions covered by the price survey throughout a year.   General government debt and result are calculated in compliance with the European Union methodology ESA 2010 (European System of National and Regional Accounts), implemented by the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 549/2013 of 21 May 2013. ESA 2010 in scope of definitions, principles, entries and classifications is generally coherent with the international system of national accounts - 2008 SNA (System of National Accounts of United Nations). Differences between ESA and SNA (mostly in the way of account's presentation) arise from the specificity of the national accounts system in the European Union, which requires greater precision in definitions and in accounting rules.   General government sector - according to the ESA2010 - includes the following entities of the national economy:  a) entities operating according to principles described in Law on Public finances (budgetary units, appropriated funds and since 2010 also local budgetary establishments, executive agencies and budget institutions as well as until 2005 special funds of budgetary entities, in 2005-2010 - own income account of budgetary entities and until 2010 - budgetary establishments and auxiliary units of budgetary entities including conducting economic activity ones as well as motivation funds), b) entities for which the financial system was defined in special regulations, and for which the subsidies from the state budget are the main source of financing (public higher education institutions, the Polish Academy of Science and entities established by it, the National Road Fund and other funds managed by Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, agriculture advisory units and state agencies), c) independent public self-government health care facilities, d) state and local government institutions of culture and national film institutions, e) funds with the legal personality which are connected with state or local government units budgets, f) institutions managing the social security funds (SII, ASIF) and these funds as well as the National Health Fund (in the period 1 I 1999&mdash;31 III 2003 &mdash; health funds), g) public hospitals in the form of limited liability companies and hospitals acting as research institutes (excluded from non-financial corporations sector), h) Bank Guarantee Fund (excluded from financial corporations sector), i) other units, including public corporations and non-commercial institutions that meet ESA 2010 classification criteria to general government sector.

The strategy assumes that all its citizens will benefit from its effects. The document focuses on the knowledge and technology that is being created in Poland, the development and further expansion of Polish companies, the construction of a savings system and the improvement of the quality of institutions and their relations with the public. The importance of inclusion all social groups and all territories in the development processes has also been emphasized. The actions outlined in the Strategy are consistent with the objectives and tasks set out in the UN Agenda 2030. The concept of sustainable and responsible development, which is the basis of the Strategy, is consistent with the UN point of view, i.e. vision of the world free from poverty, where every person has the opportunity to enjoy the development.",

                                          "methodology": "Official Development Assistance (ODA) comprises grants and loans that are provided by government agencies or international organizations to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) - the countries with the lowest levels of socio-economic development, which meet the following three criteria: average income per capita below $ 1018 for 3 years, low human resources (malnutrition, high mortality, low level of education) and the sensitivity of the economy (dependence on the production of raw materials or agricultural products). The list of LDCs covers about 50 countries (most of them are African countries). Gross National Income (GNI) - the gross primary income of all property sectors or all national institutional sectors it is the sum of gross domestic product and income from abroad.    The State Budget constitutes a part of budgetary act and determines: 1. the total amount of projected tax revenues and non-tax revenues of state budget  2. the total amount of planned budget expenditure  3. the amount of the planned state budget deficit together with the sources of its coverage  4. the total amount of projected revenues of the European Funds Budget  5. total amount of planned budget expenditures of the European Funds Budget  6. the financial result of the European Funds Budget  7. the total amount of planned income of the state budget  8. the total amount of planned expenditures of the state budget  9. the planned balance of revenues and expenditures of the state budget  10. limit for liabilities incurred on loans and securities issued.",

The grant element is calculated specifically for tied aid credits. Additionally, work is underway to include other flows in ODA, e.g. amounts mobilized by the public sector from private sector instruments. Moreover, since 2019, Poland has been reporting a new TOSSD (Total Official Support for Sustainable Development) indicator, which measures the support provided for the implementation of the SDGs at the global level.",

GDP value can be calculated in three ways:  • from the production side GDP is the sum of value added of all institutional sectors or all sections of the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) of domestic production entities plus taxes less subsidies on products,  • from the distribution side GDP is calculated as the sum of domestic demand, i.e. final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation as well as external balance of goods and services,  • as the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation of employees, taxes less subsidies on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixed income of the total economy).  Personal remittances comprise personal transfers and compensation of employees. Personal transfers consist of all current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from non-resident households. Personal transfers thus include all current transfers between resident and non-resident individuals. Compensation of employees refers to the income of border, seasonal, and other short-term workers who are employed in an economy where they are not resident and of residents employed by non-resident entities. Data are the sum of two items defined in the sixth edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual: personal transfers and compensation of employees. The methodology used is in line with the Sixth Edition of the IMF's Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6).",

One of the components of public debt is the State Treasury debt (two other components are local government debt and social security debt). Treasury debt is the government's commitment to cover, amon others, the budget deficit. State Treasury debt typically accounts for about 90% of public debt. The cost of debt service is the state budget expenditure. The costs of debt service includes primarily interest and discount on treasury securities, interest and fees on loans and borrowings received, costs of issuing treasury securities and payments under sureties and guarantees granted by the Treasury.

The first in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) usage research conducted by all national statistical offices (by Central Statistical Office in Poland) and the second in telecommunication market research conducted by national regulators of the telecommunications market (respectively by the Electronic Communications Office). The EU statistics on the telecommunications market used by the Office of Electronic Communications and the European Commission for fixed-line broadband are considered those with speeds above 144 kbps. On the other hand, for research conducted by national statistical offices, coordinated by Eurostat, broadband is defined by the type of technique used for the connection, not its speed. These include DSL technologies such as ADSL, HDSL, SDSL, VDSL, Ethernet LANs, which are the backbone of broadband connections, and others with high bandwidth (wired or wireless). Data for the indicator comes from a survey conducted twice a year by the Office of Electronic Communications for the European Commission (Digital Agenda). The survey covers about 100-120 largest telecommunications undertakings with a combined market share of over 95%. The indicator is presented according to the connection speed for the following speed ranges:  • less than 30 Mbps  • from 30 Mbps to less than 100 Mbps  • from 100 Mbps It presents the number of fixed line and wireless broadband internet subscribers per 100 persons (according to the population at the end of the year announced by the Statistics Poland). Data on population were compiled on the basis of:  • the balances of the residing population in a gmina based on the results of 2011 Population and Housing Census (for data since 2010) for previous years (2003 - 2009) on the basis of the 2002 Population and Housing Census,  • the registers of the Ministry of Interior - internal and international migration of population for permanent residence (since 2006 the presented data come from the Common Electronic System of Population Register - PESEL),  • documentation of Civil Status Offices regarding registered marriages, births and deaths.",

In Poland, monitoring of the ICT usage in households in accordance with the EU harmonized methodology was launched in 2004. Since then, the survey has been carried out annually and voluntary participation is ongoing. The study is carried out through face-to face interviews and includes households with at least one person aged 16-74 and people of that age. Two separate questionnaires: for households (SSI-10G) and individuals: (SSI-10I) are used in this survey. Mainly qualitative questions (not related to values given in numbers) and closed questions are utilized. Individual questionnaires include questions regarding:  • computer and Internet usage (when lately ?, how often ?, where?)   • Internet usage via mobile devices   • purposes of Internet usage   • making purchases online.",

In order for loans to qualify as ODA, they need to comprise a grant element of at least:  • 45% of the total amount for LDCs and other LICs (calculated at the discount rate of 9%), • 15% for LMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 7%), • 10% for UMICs (calculated at the discount rate of 6%). ODA also includes technical assistance that aims at developing human resources and raising qualifications as well as technical and productive capacity of the developing countries. Technical assistance consists in, i. a., conveying knowledge and experience in the form of training, sending experts and commencing research and/ or covering its resultant cost.  No military equipment or services are reportable as ODA.  Moreover, it is also required that a partner country benefitting from assistance is on the OECD DAC (Development Assistance Committee) list of ODA recipients.  Depending on the form of its realisation, development assistance might be distinguished into: • bilateral assistance which is undertaken by the donor country directly in the partner country or by an international organisation as earmarked contribution to the partner country or as a contribution for a specific programme/ fund managed by the organisation, • multilateral assistance, which is provided as a contribution to the general budgets of international organisations whose list is updated annually by the OECD-DAC Secretariat.  Bilateral ODA, which focuses on poverty reduction, includes the following areas of support: • basic education (CRS codes 112xx Basic Education) • basic health (CRS codes (22xx Basic Health)  • supply in water and sanitation (CRS codes 140xx Water Supply and Sanitation) • multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050 Multisector aid for basic social services) • development food aid (CRS code 52010 Development Food Aid).  Official Development Assistance in Poland is provided in accordance with the Development Cooperation Act of 16th September 2011 (Journal of Laws of 2011, No 234, item 1386). Polish development cooperation is based on the Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme, developed for a minimum period of four years. In accordance with the document, the development cooperation includes all the actions undertaken by the government administrative bodies in order to provide the developing countries with development assistance and humanitarian aid as well as the implementation of educational actions for raising awareness and better understanding of global issues and interdependencies.   The development cooperation in Poland is coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that has devised Multiannual Development Cooperation Programme for 2021-2030 in accordance with which the focus of Polish development cooperation has been placed on selected max. 10 Eastern Partnership countries as well as African, Asian and Middle East countries. „Development cooperation plan in 2023” specifies priority geographical coverage to: Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lebanon, Palestine, Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.   Polish development cooperation serves the following thematic priorities: peace, justice and strong institutions, equal chances (education, decent work, entrepreneurship, reduced inequalities, sustainable cities), health, climate and natural resources (clear water and sanitation, forests and biodiversity, renewable energy resources), in alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (16, 4, 8, 10, 3, 6, 11 and 13). Activities included in the programme are financed with the resources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Poland from target reserve of the state budget, designed for the development cooperation, and from the funds of other public administration bodies.",
