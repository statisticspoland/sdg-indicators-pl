Greenhouse gases are components of the Earth's atmosphere, which due to their physicochemical properties have the ability to retain solar energy within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Greenhouse gases refer to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (NH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for several years to thousands of years. They have an impact on the global climate, regardless of where they are emitted. The indicator is calculated excluding the balance of CO2 emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector (land use, land use change and forestry) and including indirect CO2  emissions.",

Their resources are complementary in natural processes, which practically allows treating them as inexhaustible. Moreover, obtaining energy from these sources is more environmentally friendly compared to the conventional sources (fossil fuels). The use of RES significantly reduces the harmful impact of energy on the environment, notably by reducing emissions, especially greenhouse gases. In national conditions energy from renewable sources includes energy from solar radiation, water, wind, geothermal resources and energy generated from solid biofuels, biogas and liquid biofuels as well as ambient energy obtained by heat pumps. Acquisition is the amount of energy obtained from natural resources (only for primary energy carriers).",

Separately, for each of 46 zones annual assessment is made of protection of human health for 12 pollutants (SO2, NO2, benzene, CO, O3, particulate matter PM 10, particulate matter PM 2,5, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene). On the basis of this assessment for each pollutant a class (A, B or C) is subscribed. • A class is assigned to the zone in the area of which, no exceedances were observed. • Class B is attributed to the zone which has exceeded the permissible level, but not exceeded the permissible level increased by the margin of tolerance. • Class C - is attributed to the area where, in a given year exceedances of acceptable levels augmented by the margin of tolerance or exceedances of target level were observed. Since 2015 for none of the above mentioned pollutants the margin of tolerance was specified, thus starting from the air quality assessment for 2015, depending on the pollutant concentrations, the zone can be only classified as A or C. For the indicator calculations cumulative assessment of area class is taken based on the criteria laid down for the protection of health for all pollutants for which air quality standard (acceptable levels) were specified. This applies to the results of the classification of zones for SO2, NO2, benzene, CO, particulate PM matter 10, particulate matter PM 2,5). The zone is included in the zones where in a given year exceedances of the air quality standard were observed if the permissible level increased by the margin of tolerance, is exceeded in the area of the zone for one or more of the above mentioned pollutants. In calculating the air quality index, exceedances identified on the basis of the target value is not taken into consideration, because according to the Act of 27 April 2001 - Environmental Protection Law  (Journal of Laws from 2013,  item 1232 with later amendments),  target value is not an air quality standard. The result of the calculation is expressed as a percentage according to the formula: air quality index = (number of zones with exceedance of limit values / 46) • 100%",

For 2012 and subsequent years, the national average exposure indicator is calculated as the arithmetic average of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations from the last three years (eg for 2015 the indicator was calculated in 2016 as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations for 2013-2015). For the purposes of calculating national indicator, 30 measuring stations were created whose locations were approved by the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection. Measuring stations are located in areas with a very high population density remote from dust emission sources. In cities over 100,000 inhabitants and agglomerations not exceeding 1 million inhabitants, these measurements are carried out on one measuring station. In the Warsaw Agglomeration and the Upper Silesian Agglomeration, measurements are carried out on two measurement stations. Detailed information on the location of air pollutant measuring stations PM2,5 for the purposes of calculating KW are included in voivodship environmental monitoring programs. Measurements are made using low-flow PM2.5 dust collectors, i.e. the reference method by voivodships inspectorates for environmental protection. Measurements are carried out continuously.",

This model has been developed under the auspices of the European Environment Agency (EEA) for the reporting of emissions from national road transport by Member States. The model's emission estimation methodology is consistent with the applicable IPCC and EEA guidelines used in international reporting. Pollution from means of road transport comes mainly from fuel combustion processes in car engines, abrasion of tires, brake pads in cars and secondary entrainment of dust from road surfaces. The volume of emissions from the transport sector is mainly influenced by the number and age of vehicles, the condition of road surfaces and traffic organization. Pollutants emission from road transport facilities includes: • Carbon dioxide • Methane • Nitrous oxide • Carbon oxide • Non-methane volatile organic compounds • Nitrogen oxides • Particulates (as Total Suspended Particulates) • Sulphur dioxide • Lead",

It is the ability to collect, detent and drain water in a particular place and time on the surface or in the soil, groundwater, vegetation and forest bad. Facilities of small retention of water are buildings and equipment for keeping most of the water in its surface and by-surface circulation. They are: - artificial water reservoirs with a capacity of 5 million cubic meters , - fish ponds , - self-weirs and water intake, - other weirs or transporting water.",

The coastal flooding is most frequently caused by storm wind blowing on the seacoasts in the coast direction. The storm wind hampers outflow of the rivers flowing into the sea, building up water in the river beds and sea lagoons as well as causing seawater intrusion in the estuaries.

This indicator is specified for action A. Raising awareness of invasive alien species entering the natural environment threats and ways to reduce them - which consists of the following tasks: • A.1. Production of films aimed at terrarists, aquarists, breeders of exotic animals, fishermen and gardeners. The films will inform about the ways of introducing invasive species of plants or animals into the environment in Poland, the consequences of releasing or escaping individuals of these species into the natural environment and about the legal regulations in this regard; • A.2. Preparation and publication of thematic articles in the press, on the website or in social networking sites regarding legal provisions relating to the introduction of invasive species of plants and animals into the environment and describing ways to prevent the escape of alien species of ornamental plants from crops and alien species of domestic animals and species kept in aquariums and terrariums; • A.4. Promotion of the code of good practice 'Gardening against invasive plants of foreign origin' and its ongoing updating; • A.5. Conducting educational campaigns to promote issues related to the problem of invasive species entering the natural environment: ornamental plant species in non-commercial horticultural crops and pets, species used in aquaristics and terrariums, as well as issues related to animal asylums.
