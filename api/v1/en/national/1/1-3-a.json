High indicator values indicate an oversupply of dwellings, the result of which maybe economic difficulties, such as the difficulty of maintaining unused resources. The value of theindicator is also affected by cultural and demographic factors, such as the average number ofchildren per family, the average age and cultural habits of the extended families living together. The data concerning the number of dwellings are derived from censuses and reports on dwellingstocks, on the costs and revenues of maintaining dwelling stocks, on rates of charges in buildingswith dwellings, as well as from reports on housing and communal economy of the community.",
