The indicator shows dwelling stocks of a selected territorial unit. Low indicator values indicate a shortage of dwellings, which could result in social problems, such as problems with the emancipation of young people. High indicator values indicate an oversupply of dwellings, the result of which maybe economic difficulties, such as the difficulty of maintaining unused resources. The value of the indicator is also affected by cultural and demographic factors, such as the average number of children per family, the average age and cultural habits of the extended families living together. The data concerning the number of dwellings are derived from censuses and reports on dwelling stocks, on the costs and revenues of maintaining dwelling stocks, on rates of charges in buildings with dwellings, as well as from reports on housing and communal economy of the community.",
