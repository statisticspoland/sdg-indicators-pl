The survey covers persons aged 15-89, who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. The indicator includes training of adults at schools for adults as well as getting and improving general knowledge, professional skills and competences outside school (in the four weeks preceding the survey) by persons who completed compulsory education. The adult education includes the following forms: • formal education - defined as institutionally organized learning activities through educational programmes and trainings leading to vocational qualifications; • non-formal education - defined as institutionally organized learning activities, however, outside educational programmes and trainings leading to vocational qualifications; • informal education - defined as not institutionally organized intentional or unintentional learning activities.",

From 2023 onwards, data on Poland's resident population living in dwellings, derived from balance sheets compiled on the basis of Census 2021 results, were used to generalise the LFS results to the general population. Data for 2021-2022 were compiled according to the new basis of generalisation. Due to the changes introduced, the LFS results are not fully comparable with the survey results for the years prior to 2021.",
