Greenhouse gases are components of the Earth's atmosphere, which due to their physicochemical properties have the ability to retain solar energy within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Greenhouse gases refer to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (NH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and industrial gases: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for several years to thousands of years. They have an impact on the global climate, regardless of where they are emitted. The indicator is calculated excluding the balance of CO2 emissions and removals from the LULUCF sector (land use, land use change and forestry) and including indirect CO2  emissions.",
