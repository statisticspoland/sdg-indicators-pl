Base 1990 = 100.The CO2 equivalent unit is one megagram (1 Mg) of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gas quantity, representing the equivalent of 1 Mg of carbon dioxide, calculated using the global worming coefficient.The global worming coefficient is an indicator comparing the power of influence of greenhouse gas for the global worming to the power of influence of carbon dioxide; it is calculated on the basis of the influence effect of one kilogram of a given gas for the procces of global warming in the period of 100 years, compared to influence effect of one kilogram of CO2. Global worming coefficients amount to: for carbon dioxide - 1, for methane - 25, for nitrous oxide - 298, for fluorocarbones - from 124 for HFC 152a to 14800 for HFC-23, sulfur hexafluoride - 22800, perfluorocarbones from 7390 for CF4 to 12200 for C2F6, nitrogen trifluoroide - 17200.",
