This model has been developed under the auspices of the European Environment Agency (EEA) for the reporting of emissions from national road transport by Member States. The model's emission estimation methodology is consistent with the applicable IPCC and EEA guidelines used in international reporting. Pollution from means of road transport comes mainly from fuel combustion processes in car engines, abrasion of tires, brake pads in cars and secondary entrainment of dust from road surfaces. The volume of emissions from the transport sector is mainly influenced by the number and age of vehicles, the condition of road surfaces and traffic organization. Pollutants emission from road transport facilities includes: • Carbon dioxide • Methane • Nitrous oxide • Carbon oxide • Non-methane volatile organic compounds • Nitrogen oxides • Particulates (as Total Suspended Particulates) • Sulphur dioxide • Lead",
