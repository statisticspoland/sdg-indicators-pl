                            "methodology": "The indicator measures the proportion of the population who declare that they are affected either by noise from neighbours or from the street. Because the assessment of noise pollution is subjective, it should be noted that the indicator accounts for both the levels of noise pollution as well as people's standards of what level they consider to be acceptable. Therefore, an increase in the value of the indicator may not necessarily indicate a similar increase in noise pollution levels but also a decrease of the levels that European citizens are willing to tolerate and vice versa. The indicator is calculated on the basis of information obtained from the EU-SILC survey. EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is a panel study, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behavior or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview technique using 2 questionnaires; one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Central Statistical Office of Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005. The survey unit is a household, which is understood as persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household).

It is an optional document, i.e. gminas (communes) do not have the obligation to draw it up. The local plan shall mandatory include, among others: - use of land and the lines dividing areas for various land use; - the principles of environment, nature and cultural landscape protection; - the principles of cultural heritage, monuments and contemporary culture goods protection; - building lines, overall dimension of objects and indicators of build-up intensity; - the principles of modernization, expansion and building of communication systems and technical infrastructure. The consequence of the preparation of the local plan is an obligation to draw up documents such as economic impact forecast for adoption of local spatial management plan and environmental impact assessment.The solutions proposed in the plan may in fact significantly affect the transformation of the natural environment and the value of the properties. According to the law the content of the plan is divided into mandatory and optional part. The project of the plan is a subject of public consultations, requires a range of opinions and agreements to which act refers to.

Units with a higher value of the indicator are characterized by higher availability.  The indicator is built on the basis of a potential accessibility model, for which the attractiveness of the travel/transport destination (population in passenger transport and population and GDP in freight transport) decreases with increasing travel/transport time.  The value of the indicator depends on changes in the network (transport) and changes in population or GDP. For this reason, there are no adopted maximum MAI values.  There are two versions of the indicator: MAI I  (used in research in 2008 and 2010) anT MAI II. Since 2013, the MAI indicator has been calculated according to the verified methodology (MAI II), which provides full opportunities to study changes in accessibility since Poland's accession to the European Union. The creation of the MAI II indicator was related to the needs of evaluating transport investments financed in 2014–2020, as well as enabling full monitoring of progress in the implementation of strategic documents.  The indicator is based on the potential availability model. In the version of MAI II, poviat was replaced by gmina as the basic unit for which the value of the indicator is measured.  The MAI indicator has no units of measure (it is a feature of potential accessibility). It was assumed that centers with a higher value of the indicator (which in the MAI I model could take a value from 0 to 1, and in the MAI II model can take various positive values) are characterized by higher transport accessibility.  A detailed description of the verified methodology for using the the MAI II indicator is included in the notification 'Estimation of the expected results of intervention using measures of transport accessibility adapted to the needs of strategic and operational documents of the transport perspective 2014–2020 (updated 2020/2021)' at: http://www.ewaluacja.gov.pl",

These indicators are calculated as three-year moving averages from measurements of PM2.5 concentrations for individual cities and agglomerations (e.g. indicators for cities and agglomerations for 2018 were calculated as the average of annual average PM2.5 concentrations from 2016-2018 for these cities and agglomerations). The calculations take into account the results of measurements from 32 measuring stations selected in accordance with the requirements for conducting measurements in this area. In every city with more than 100 thous. inhabitants and in each agglomeration there is one measurement station, the results of which are used to calculate it (the exceptions are the agglomerations: Upper Silesia and Warsaw, where there are two measurement stations). The number of agglomerations and cities with more than 100 thous. inhabitants where the average exposure indicator does not exceed the exposure concentration obligation, is calculated by summing all the cities with more than 100 thous. inhabitants and agglomerations where the average exposure indicator for PM 2.5 has not exceeded 20 µg/m3 in a current year. The exposure concentration ceiling is the concentration of a substance in the air, determined on the basis of the value of the national average exposure indicator, in order to limit the harmful effects of a given substance on human health, which is to be achieved within a specified period. The exposure concentration ceiling is an air quality standard and has been specified only for PM2.5 dust. The exposure concentration ceiling applies to urban background areas in cities with more than 100 thous. inhabitants. inhabitants and in agglomerations and was defined by the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of August 24, 2012 on the levels of certain substances in the air (Journal of Laws of 2012, item 1031). The value of the PM2.5 exposure concentration ceiling is 20 µg/m3. The calculation method of AEI is defined in the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of September 13, 2012 on the Method for Calculation of Average Exposure Indicator and Method for Assessment of Achieving Exposure Concentration Obligation (Journal of Laws of 2012, item 1029). List of agglomerations and cities over 100 thous. inhabitants in which the value of the average exposure indicator does not exceed the limit of PM2.5 exposure concentration for a given calendar year is published in Monitor Polski by September 30 of the following year.",
