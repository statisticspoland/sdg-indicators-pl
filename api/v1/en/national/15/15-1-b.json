Degraded land refer to land, which agricultural or forestry value diminished, due to deterioration of natural conditions or environmental changes as well as industrial activity and harmful agricultural activity. Loss or reduction of utility value of land is a total loss or a reduction in the production capacity of the land. Land reclamation means creation or restoration of utility or natural value for degraded or devastated land through proper formation of the landscape, enhancements of physical and chemical properties, regulation of water conditions, and restoration of soil, reinforcement of scarps and reconstruction or construction of indispensable routes. Reclaimed land is subject to development i.e. agricultural, forest or other type of utilization. Land designated for reclamation includes degraded or devastated land, such as: closed dumps, landfills, landslides, lands on which industrial and mining activities were carried out, and military fields for which the competent authority has approved reclamation projects.",
