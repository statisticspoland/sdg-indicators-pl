In the Polish legal system, 'contract' and 'agreement' are often used interchangeably. For contracts of lower rank, names such as 'agreement', 'protocol' and also Memorandum of Understanding have been designated. A Memorandum of Understanding is a type of agreement between two or more parties. It expresses the convergence of will of the parties, indicating the intended common line of action. It is often used in cases where the parties do not imply a legal obligation or in situations where the parties cannot create a legally enforceable contract.",
