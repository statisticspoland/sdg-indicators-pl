Events of this type are usually held by a wider group of specialists in a given field, who present papers in various forms and then discuss them. A training is an event containing both elements of a lecture and a practical exercise. An important element of the training is its focus on the effect - that is, the increase in knowledge and skills of the participants. Therefore, part of the training is to check the acquired knowledge and skills, which are then documented with an appropriate certificate or diploma.",
