Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy. GDP is the sum of gross value added generated by all national institutional units, increased by taxes on products less subsidies on products. Resource productivity provides information on whether there is decoupling of economic growth and natural resource use and, by implication, reduction of the negative impact of the economy on the environment. The resource productivity indicator is presented at constant prices as of 2010 (euro/kg) - for comparison of resource productivity in time for a single territorial unit.",

The overall material use is measured by summing up the aggregate domestic material consumption (DMC) and the circular use of materials. DMC is defined in economy-wide material flow accounts. The circular use of materials is approximated by the amount of waste recycled in domestic recovery plants minus imported waste destined for recovery plus exported waste destined for recovery abroad. Waste recycled in domestic recovery plants comprises the recovery operations R2 to R11 - as defined in the Waste Framework Directive 75/442/EEC. The imports and exports of waste destined for recycling - i.e. the amount of imported and exported waste bound for recovery - are approximated from the European statistics on international trade in goods. A higher CMU rate value means that more secondary materials substitute for primary raw materials thus reducing the environmental impacts of extracting primary material.",
