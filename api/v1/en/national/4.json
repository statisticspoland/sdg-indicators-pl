The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using the continuous observation method (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15-89, who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week:  - performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed in a company/public institution or by a private employer, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture, - had work but did not perform it:   • due to illness or holiday leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, childcare, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (work system or overtime collection), training related to the performed work, • due to the seasonal character of the work, if they still regularly performed off-season their work or business conducting related tasks and responsibilities (excluding legal or administrative obligations), • for other reasons, if the anticipated break in employment did not exceed 3 months.  In accordance with international standards, among employees are also included apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). The employed do not include: volunteers and interns who do not receive remuneration, people working in private engaged in the production of agricultural products solely or mainly for their ownneeds. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 who simultaneously fulfil three conditions:  - within the reference week were not employed, - were actively looking for work, i.e. for over 4 weeks (the reference week being the fourth one) had been involved in concrete actions aimed at finding a job, - were available to take up work within two weeks after the reference week.  Persons who were not seeking work because they had already found a job, were only waiting to start work within the period no longer than 3 months, and were available for this job are also included in the category of the unemployed. Among school-leavers are included persons at the age 15-30 years who completed school during the last 12 months and who do not continue education.",

Due to the changes introduced, the LFS results are not fully comparable with the survey results for the years prior to 2021. In addition, the lack of comparability of the data time series is also affected by methodological changes introduced to the LFS from Q1 2021.

The aim of the programme is to verify the practical application of knowledge acquired in school and outside the school. The survey (representative) is carried out in randomly selected schools, and depending on the type of school, it covers randomly selected students aged 15-16 (results are generalized to the entire population). The success of the survey depends on the participation of all sampled schools and students. PISA standards only allow a small-scale denial. PISA tests students skills in three subject areas: reading and interpretation, mathematics and scientific literacy. The survey is carried out every three years, since 2000. In each of the subsequent surveys, a particular emphasis is put on the examination of one area (reading literacy in 2000 and 2009), which takes half of the time provided for the student to solve the entire set of tasks. PISA tests (developed by an international consortium, with the cooperation of the countries participating in the project) are different from typical school activities, and on the basis of the results, the level of student skills is estimated. The best students reach level 5 or 6 (tasks with a relatively high degree of difficulty), while results below level 2 - a minimum level of competence - indicate very basic skills, which means an higher risk of not coping with education and adult life. PISA is one of the most important and the biggest educational surveys, which aims to provideobjective and internationally comparable data on the same year students' skills.",

The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population.",

From 2023 onwards, data on Poland's resident population living in dwellings, derived from balance sheets compiled on the basis of Census 2021 results, were used to generalise the LFS results to the general population. Data for 2021-2022 were compiled according to the new basis of generalisation. Due to the changes introduced, the LFS results are not fully comparable with the survey results for the years prior to 2021.",

The survey covers persons aged 15-89, who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. The indicator includes training of adults at schools for adults as well as getting and improving general knowledge, professional skills and competences outside school (in the four weeks preceding the survey) by persons who completed compulsory education. The adult education includes the following forms: • formal education - defined as institutionally organized learning activities through educational programmes and trainings leading to vocational qualifications; • non-formal education - defined as institutionally organized learning activities, however, outside educational programmes and trainings leading to vocational qualifications; • informal education - defined as not institutionally organized intentional or unintentional learning activities.",

From 2023 onwards, data on Poland's resident population living in dwellings, derived from balance sheets compiled on the basis of Census 2021 results, were used to generalise the LFS results to the general population. Data for 2021-2022 were compiled according to the new basis of generalisation. Due to the changes introduced, the LFS results are not fully comparable with the survey results for the years prior to 2021.",
