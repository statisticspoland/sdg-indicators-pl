Gross domestic product (GDP) illustrates the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy (resident producer units - domestic) in a given year. The exact definition and methodology for calculating GDP is contained in the regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010). An Agriculture Orientation Index (AOI) greater than 1 reflects a higher orientation towards the agriculture sector, which receives a higher share of government spending relative to its contribution to economic value added. An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI = 1 reflects neutrality in a government orientation to the agriculture sector.",

R&D includes: scientific research (basic, applied, industrial) and experimental development. Intramural expenditures on R&D are expenditures incurred in a reporting year on R&D in the reported entity, irrespective of origin of such funds, i.e. including funds obtained from abroad (exports of R&D). They cover both current expenditures and investment outlays on fixed assets related to R&;D, but do not cover depreciation of these assets. Intramural expenditures on R&D are examined according to the fields of science divided into: natural, engineering and technology, medical and health, agricultural, social as well as humanities sciences. Expenditures on R&D by fields of science are converted according to the percentage share of total expenditures. According to Frascati Manual, agricultural science is a field of science that covers the following fields: agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, animal and dairy science, veterinary science, agricultural biotechnology as well as other agricultural sciences. Gross domestic product (GDP) presents the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy in a given year. GDP value can be calculated in three ways: - from the production side GDP is the sum of value added of all institutional sectors or all sections of the Polish Classification of Activities (PKD) of domestic production entities plus taxes less subsidies on products, - from the distribution side GDP is calculated as the sum of domestic demand, i.e. final consumption expenditure and gross capital formation as well as external balance of goods and services, - as the sum of uses in the total economy generation of income account (compensation ofemployees, taxes less subsidies on production and imports, gross operating surplus and mixedincome of the total economy). Gross domestic product is calculated according to the principles of the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA 2010), whicha are obligatory in the European Union countries, and recommendations of the Eurostat.",

Organic agricultural land is land where the organic methods of agricultural production are implemented. The area of certified organic agricultural land in organic holdings covers agricultural land area whose conversion to organic agriculture has been finished. The agricultural land area includes area of agricultural land in a good agricultural condition and other agricultural land. Agricultural land in a good agricultural condition - maintained in accordance with norms meeting requirements of the Law of 5 II 2015 on payments under direct support schemes (uniform text Journal of Laws 2015 item 1551) - include sown area, fallow land, permanent crops (including orchards), kitchen gardens, permanent meadows and permanent pastures.

The household budget survey is conducted using representative method based on random sample which allows generalisation, within a margin of an error, of the results for all households in the country. The monthly rotation of households implemented since 1993 assumes that every month of the year a different group of households participates in the survey. The survey covers one-person and multi-person households. Households of foreign citizens with permanent or long-lasting residence in Poland and using Polish language also take part in the survey. The purpose of the survey is to enable the analysis of the living standards of the population as well as evaluate the impact of various factors on the living standard and its diversity among basic groups of households.  Household budget survey  provides detailed information on:  âˆ™ the level and the structure of expenditures, sources of acquiring goods and services;  âˆ™ the consumption level of basic food products according to quantity, but also energetic value and nutrients;  âˆ™ prices at which households purchase selected goods and services;  âˆ™ the level and sources of their incomes;  âˆ™ household equipment with durables;  âˆ™ dwelling conditions;  âˆ™ subjective evaluation of the material condition of households;  âˆ™ demographic and social structure of the households i.e. on the number, age, gender, education, disability and economic activity of the members of the surveyed household.  The survey unit is a household, which is understood as the persons who may be related or unrelated, living together and maintaining themselves jointly (multi-person household). Household can also be formed by one individual maintaining himself/herself independently, regardless of whether the individual lives alone or with other persons (one-person household). Disposable income is designated for consumer goods and services expenditures and for savings increase. Disposable income is available income less other expenditures. Available income is designated for expenditure and savings increase. It is a sum of household's current incomes from various sources reduced by prepayments on personal income tax, by tax on income from property, taxes paid by self-employed persons ( including those in free professions and individual farmers) and by social security and health insurance premiums. The available income covers both income in cash and in kind, including natural consumption (consumer goods and services taken to satisfy household's needs from self-employment - in and outside farming) as well as goods and services received free of charge. Available income consists of:  income from hired work, income from private farm in agriculture, income from self-employment other than in private farm in agriculture and income from practising free profession, income from property, income from rental of a property, social insurance benefits, other benefits, other incomes (including gifts and alimonies).    Expenditures on consumer goods and services  are allocated to satisfying household's needs. They include products purchased by cash, also using debt or credit card, on credit, received free of charge and natural consumption (consumer goods and services taken from individual farm or own economic activity to satisfy household's needs). Consumer goods comprise non-durable goods (e.g. food, beverages or medicines), semi-durable goods (e.g. clothes, books, toys) and durable goods (e.g. cars, washing machines, refrigerators, television sets).   Other expenditures  include:  âˆ™ gifts donated to other households and non-commercial institutions;  âˆ™ certain taxes, such as tax on legacy and donations, tax on real estates, fees for perpetual use of the land;   âˆ™ prepayments of personal income tax and social security contributions paid directly by the tax payer;  âˆ™ other kinds of expenditures not allocated directly to consumption, including sums lost in gambling and lotteries, losses of cash and bails.",

Agricultural-foodstuff goods cover 4 sections of the CN nomenclature, namely vegetable products, live animals, prepered agricultural-foodstuff goods and oils and fats. As of 1 May 2004, the source of data on foreign trade statistics is:INTRASTAT declarations - used for registration of turnover with EU countries; Customs declarations in the EXTRASTAT system - used to record the foreign trade with non-EU countries (so-called third countries).Since 1 January 2006, in Polish foreign trade statistics, alternative data sources have also been used for registration of movements of specific goods such as: sea vessels, aircraft, sea products, including purchase/sale of fishery which were the subject of trade transaction before being landed by sea-going vessels, electricity and natural gas. The value of imports is shown in terms of cif Polish port or franco Polish border, i.e. including transport and insurance costs to the Polish border. The value of export is shown on the fob basis, that is in terms of franco border or fob port of the country of delivery.",

A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese. Body mass index (BMI) is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres (kg/m2). For adults over 20 years old, BMI falls into one of the following categories:   18.5 - 24.9 - normal weight, 25.0 - 29.9 - pre-obesity, 30.0 - 34.9 - obesity class I, 35.0 - 39.9 - obesity class II, >=40 - obesity class III.  The BMI ranges are based on the effect excessive body fat has on disease and death and are reasonably well related to adiposity. BMI was developed as a risk indicator of disease; as BMI increases, so does the risk for some diseases. Some common conditions related to overweight and obesity include: premature death, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, some cancers and diabetes. Data comes from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), repeated every 5 years. The results of the study enable to get to know the health situation of the inhabitants of the Union and its conditions in connection with the demographic and social characteristics and the place of residence. The study covers four areas:  health status (including self-assessment of health status, chronic diseases, limitations in functioning and their impact on everyday life, psychological well-being), health care (use of medical care, use of medicines, prophylaxis), health determinants (mainly lifestyle and exposure to adverse environmental factors) and demographic and social characteristics of persons and households.

A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). To assess the nutritional status of children in developmental age, tables or centile grids of BMI values based on age are used, separate for boys and girls. According to the current WHO definition: - overweight is a disorder where the value of the BMI is equal to or greater than 85 percentile (>=85c) and less than 97 percentile ( - obesity is recognized when the value of the BMI is equal to or greater than the 97 percentile (>=97c). Data comes from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), repeated every 5 years. The results of the study enable to get to know the health situation of the inhabitants of the Union and its conditions in connection with the demographic and social characteristics and the place of residence. The study covers four areas:  health status (including self-assessment of health status, chronic diseases, limitations in functioning and their impact on everyday life, psychological well-being), health care (use of medical care, use of medicines, prophylaxis), health determinants (mainly lifestyle and exposure to adverse environmental factors) and demographic and social characteristics of persons and households.
