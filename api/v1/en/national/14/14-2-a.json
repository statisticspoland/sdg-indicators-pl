Data on average paid employment in maritime economy refer to the number of full- and part-time employees converted to full-time equivalents, excluding persons employed abroad. Full-time paid employees are persons employed on a full-time basis, as defined by a given company or for a given position as well as persons who, in accordance with regulations, work a reduced work-time period, e.g. due to hazardous conditions or an extended work-time period (e.g. property caretaker). Part-time paid employees are persons, who in accordance with labour contracts, regularly work on a part-time basis, as defined by a given company or for a given position. Part-time paid employees in the main workplace are persons who declared that the given workplace is their main workplace.",
