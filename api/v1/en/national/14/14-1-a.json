                        "methodology": "The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, to which the Union is a party, imposes obligations related to the protection, including maintenance or restoration of the population of the fished species at levels that the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Maximum Sustainable Yield is understood as the largest catch that can be taken from fish stocks for an period. The aim of this threshold is to achieve maximum efficiency of fish stocks while maintaining biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems relevant to present and future generations. Fish stocks are considered to be sustainable if their numbers persist at a level that ensures maximum sustainable yield or higher. In order to ensure that basic industrial species in the Baltic Sea are operated at a renewable level, Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 has been drawn up and adopted establishing a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks (amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007). This regulation specifies the maximum level of fishing (maximum sustainable yield) of the species in question by imposing conservation obligations, including maintaining or restoring populations of target species at renewable levels. The indicator adopts four dimensions, i.e .:1. proportion of fully exploited fish stocks2. proportion of fish stocks not fully exploited3. proportion of fish stocks over-exploited) and4. proportion of stocks within sustainable biological limit Sustainable levels include those fish stocks which, according to the stock assessment, were classified as 'not fully exploited' and 'fully exploited'. The indicator is calculated as the sum of these two categories divided by the total number of fish species subject to resource assessment and multiplied by 100. The assessment of stocks includes fish stocks as defined in Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council for which a multi-annual plan has been established:1. Atlantic cod in the western part of the Baltic Sea2. Atlantic cod in the eastern part of the Baltic Sea3. Atlantic herring in the western part of the Baltic Sea4. Atlantic herring in the central part of the Baltic Sea5. sprat in the Baltic Sea",
