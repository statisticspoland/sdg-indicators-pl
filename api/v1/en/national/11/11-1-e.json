A single pass is considered a transported passenger by public transport. The number of passengers is estimated on the basis of the number of one-off and multi-trip tickets sold, taking into account the standards for the number of journeys for a given multi-pass ticket accepted by public transport establishments. Data refer to enterprises and municipal transport companies employing more than 9 people. Data on residents of urban areas were taken from statistical information on the number of population in cities according to the actual place of residence.",
