The value of indicator of 88 in year 2010 means that in this year FBI was 12% lower than in base year.

According to the above the national average exposure indicator for 2010 was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2.5 concentrations in 2011. The index for 2011 was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2.5 concentrations in 2010-2011 in 2012. For 2012 and subsequent years, the national average exposure indicator is calculated as the arithmetic average of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations from the last three years (eg for 2015 the indicator was calculated in 2016 as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations for 2013-2015). For the purposes of calculating national indicator, 30 measuring stations were created whose locations were approved by the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection. Measuring stations are located in areas with a very high population density remote from dust emission sources. In cities over 100,000 inhabitants and agglomerations not exceeding 1 million inhabitants, these measurements are carried out on one measuring station. In the Warsaw Agglomeration and the Upper Silesian Agglomeration, measurements are carried out on two measurement stations. Detailed information on the location of air pollutant measuring stations PM2,5 for the purposes of calculating KW are included in voivodship environmental monitoring programs. Measurements are made using low-flow PM2.5 dust collectors, i.e. the reference method by voivodships inspectorates for environmental protection. Measurements are carried out continuously.",

The types and amount of pollutants in industrial wastewater are very diverse. They depend on the type of industry, type of raw materials used in production and the production technology used. In statistics, the industrial wastewater also include cooling water, polluted and saline waters from mine drainage and sewage works as well as social and living wastewaters related to manufacturing processes.  Data on industrial wastewater refer to sewage discharged by the entities, which according to Polish Classification of Activity were included under 'Industry' covering ”Mining and quarrying”, ”Manufacturing”, ”Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply” and “Water supply sewerage, waste management and remediation activities” as well as other sections, whose share in the volume of discharged sewage is insignificant. Industrial wastewater requiring treatment means sewage discharged via a network of open canals or ditches directly to waters, ground or sewage network from production entities (including water contaminated as a result of dehydration of mines and contaminated waters used in industry for cooling). Municipal wastewater means domestic wastewater or mixture of domestic wastewater with industrial sewage and rainwater disposed of by a commune through sewage water system and wastewater treatment plants.Data on municipal wastewaters cover sewage discharged via a sewage network by the units managed by water supply and sewage companies and plants established by a voivode (or managed by territorial self-local governments) and from 1994 all units supervising collective discharge of sewage via sewage network (including housing cooperatives, water companies, water service plants, enterprises etc.) Prior to discharge to the recipient, all the sewage should be treated. Thus, in the statistics, the wastewater means wastewater requiring treatment. The data do not include precipitation and infiltration water discharged via sewage network. Wastewater treated is wastewater subjected to the process of adjusting to environmental standards or other quality standards. Three methods are distinguished: mechanical, chemical and biological processes or increased biogene removal (including chemical). For the purpose of calculating the total amount of treated wastewater, only the amount which was subjected to the highest mentioned biogene removal is presented. Therefore, wastewater treated mechanically and biologically should be reported as wastewater treated biologically and the wastewater treated using all methods should be reported as treated using increased biogene removal method. Wastewater requiring treatment is wastewater which prior to discharge to the recipient, should undergo treatment processes.",
