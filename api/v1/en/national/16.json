General government sector includes the following entities of the national economy:a) entities operating according to principles described in Law on Public finances (budgetary units, appropriated funds and since 2010 also local budgetary establishments, executive agencies and budget institutions as well as until 2005 special funds of budgetary entities, in 2005,2010, own income account of budgetary entities and until 2010, budgetary establishments and auxiliary units of budgetary entities including conducting economic activity ones as well as motivation funds),b) entities for which the financial system was defined in special regulations, and for which the subsidies from the state budget are the main source of financing (public higher educationinstitutions, the Polish Academy of Science and entities established by it, the National Road Fund and other funds managed by Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, agriculture advisory units and state agencies),c) independent public self-government health care facilities, d) state and local government institutions of culture and national film institutions,e) funds with the legal personality which are connected with state or local government units budgets,f) institutions managing the social security funds (SII, ASIF) and these funds as well as the National Health Fund (in the period 1 I 1999 31 III 2003, health funds),g) public hospitals in the form of limited liability companies and hospitals acting as research institutes (excluded from non-financial corporations sector),h) Bank Guarantee Fund (excluded from financial corporations sector),i) other units, including public corporations and non-commercial institutions that meet ESA 2010 classification criteria to general government sector. Gross domestic product (GDP) illustrates the final result of the activity of all entities of the national economy (resident producer units domestic) in a given year. The exact definition and methodology for calculating GDP is contained in the regulation of the Parliament and of the Council (EU) No 549/2013 of 21 May 2013 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010).
