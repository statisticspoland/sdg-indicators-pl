Health of the EU-SILC individual questionnaire). The survey covers adult persons aged 16 and more in a households. EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is the instrument which focuses on providing current and comparable at the Member States level data on income, poverty, social exclusion, living conditions and health state. It is a questionnaire survey carried out every year (with the use of the panel method in the four-year cycle which makes it possible to analyze changes in social phenomena and in the period of time covered by the survey). The organization and methodology of the survey is governed by the Regulation (EC) No. 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). EU-SILC survey was implemented in the European Union in the years 2004-2007, and in Poland it has been conducted since 2005. The survey method - EU-SILC is a non-obligatory, representative questionnaire survey of individual households, carried out by the face-to-face interview technique. For individual interviews a proxy interview is allowed with another household member who is able to provide reliable information concerning the person who should be covered by the survey (this is applicable to the household members who are absent in the place of residence at the time of the survey). HLY indicator serves to measure the number of years that a person lives in a healthy condition. It combines information on age-specific mortality (age-specific deaths) and vulnerability to diseases (age-specific proportions of the population in healthy and unhealthy condition). A healthy condition is defined as one without limitation in everyday functioning and without disability. This statistical indicator is compiled separately for men and women. The Healthy Life Years (HLY) indicator is one of European Structural Indicators and refers to health as a factor connected with the development and well-being. HLY indicator has been developed as a result of observation that not all years, defined by expected length of life, are lived in a healthy condition. The HLY indicator level - as other measures of the expected health state - is calculated following the Sullivan method widely used since the 70s. The method is based on measures of frequency of disability in the population of a given age (the self-perceived disability) and on mortality tables.",

Self-reported unmet needs concern a person's own assessment of whether he or she needed medical examination or treatment (dental care excluded), but did not have it or did not seek it. The indicator is calculated on the basis of househols' equivalised disposable income obtained from the EU-SILC survey. EU-SILC survey (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is a constant survey (conducted every year) whose subject are households and persons aged 16 and more in households. The survey is of a panel character, i.e. selected group of respondents is subject to several rounds of observation at intervals, so that it allows to observe and analyze the changing situation, attitudes, behaviour or opinions of a surveyed group. Survey is conducted by face-to-face interview technique using 2 questionnaires; one of which is used to obtain data on households, and the second to obtain data on individuals. The purpose of EU-SILC survey is to obtain information which allows the assessment of living conditions of Polish society and allows to compare them to the living conditions in other countries of European Union. This is achieved by adoption of a uniform methodology by Eurostat. At current requests of European Union authorities, module surveys devoted to selected issue are also conducted within EU-SILC survey (that is an additional questionnaire proceeded together with the basic survey). Central Statistical Office of Poland implemented EU-SILC survey in 2005.",

Since 2012, personal invitations to colonoscopy to persons aged 55-64 have been sent within PBP. The aim of the program is to reduce the number of cases and deaths from colon cancer. Colon cancer is a cancer that develops from benign lesions, so-called polyps (its development lasts for a dozen or so years). Thanks to the early detection and removal of polyps, it is possible to prevent the development of colon cancer. Such prophylactic examinations reduce the risk of colon cancer by 60-90%.   Data on population were compiled on the basis of: - the balances of the residing population in a gmina based on the results of 2011 Population and Housing Census (for data since 2010) for previous years (2003 - 2009) on the basis of the 2002 Population and Housing Census, the registers of the Ministry of Interior - internal and international migration of population for permanent residence (since 2006 the presented data come from the Common Electronic System of Population Register - PESEL), - documentation of Civil Status Offices regarding registered marriages, births and deaths. According to the national definition of residence, the population of a given commune includes people residing there (staying) for a period of at least 3 months. This means that the population of a given commune is captured: - permanent residents (people registered there or permanently living without registration), with the exception of those residents who left for another commune in the country for more than 3 months, - people who have arrived from another place in the country for more than three months.",

The subjective scope of the NHA survey are the patterns of public / compulsory and private / non-compulsory expenditures for health care, while the subject matter - current expenditure on health care) Compiled in accordance with ICHA (HP - suppliers, HF - financing schemes and HC - functional classification of provided health services) and in interrelationships: HCxHF, HPxHF, HCxHP. The amount of expenditures included in NHA, in accordance with the applicable methodology, covers current expenditures, so it does not include capital expenditure, which includes, for example, investment expenditures, research and development, education. The source of information for NHA in the area of public spending (HF.1), which consists of government diagrams, obligatory schemes - insurance premiums, are, among others, administrative systems of institutions which collect data on expenditure on health care (i.e. Ministry of Health, National Health Fund, Social Insurance Institution, Agricultural Social Insurance Fund, Ministry of the Interior and Administration, Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, State Fund for Rehabilitation of Disabled People). The results of other research carried out as part of the program of statistical surveys of official statistics and other available sources of information, mainly for estimating private expenditure, are also used. Based on the classification of the health care function (ICHA-HC), two types of expenditures were distinguished: expenditures on individual services and expenditures on collective services. Individual services are medical products and services used directly by individual persons according to their needs, belonging to the functional categories: curative care (HC.1), rehabilitative care (HC.2), long-term care (health) (HC.3), ancillary services (non-specified by function) (HC.4) and medical goods (non-specified by function) (HC.5). Collective services are services that can be applied to all population groups, belonging to the functional categories preventive care (HC.6) and governance and health system and financing administration (HC.7).",

The index for 2011 was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2.5 concentrations in 2010-2011 in 2012. For 2012 and subsequent years, the national average exposure indicator is calculated as the arithmetic average of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations from the last three years (eg for 2015 the indicator was calculated in 2016 as the arithmetic mean of the average annual PM2,5 concentrations for 2013-2015). For the purposes of calculating national indicator, 30 measuring stations were created whose locations were approved by the Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection. Measuring stations are located in areas with a very high population density remote from dust emission sources. In cities over 100,000 inhabitants and agglomerations not exceeding 1 million inhabitants, these measurements are carried out on one measuring station. In the Warsaw Agglomeration and the Upper Silesian Agglomeration, measurements are carried out on two measurement stations. Detailed information on the location of air pollutant measuring stations PM2,5 for the purposes of calculating KW are included in voivodship environmental monitoring programs. Measurements are made using low-flow PM2.5 dust collectors, i.e. the reference method by voivodships inspectorates for environmental protection.
