                                      "methodology": "Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese. Body mass index (BMI) is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres (kg/m2). For adults over 20 years old, BMI falls into one of the following categories:   18.5 - 24.9 - normal weight, 25.0 - 29.9 - pre-obesity, 30.0 - 34.9 - obesity class I, 35.0 - 39.9 - obesity class II, >=40 - obesity class III.  The BMI ranges are based on the effect excessive body fat has on disease and death and are reasonably well related to adiposity. BMI was developed as a risk indicator of disease; as BMI increases, so does the risk for some diseases. Some common conditions related to overweight and obesity include: premature death, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, some cancers and diabetes. Data comes from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), repeated every 5 years. The results of the study enable to get to know the health situation of the inhabitants of the Union and its conditions in connection with the demographic and social characteristics and the place of residence. The study covers four areas:  health status (including self-assessment of health status, chronic diseases, limitations in functioning and their impact on everyday life, psychological well-being), health care (use of medical care, use of medicines, prophylaxis), health determinants (mainly lifestyle and exposure to adverse environmental factors) and demographic and social characteristics of persons and households.

Health of the EU-SILC individual questionnaire). The survey covers adult persons aged 16 and more in a households. EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is the instrument which focuses on providing current and comparable at the Member States level data on income, poverty, social exclusion, living conditions and health state. It is a questionnaire survey carried out every year (with the use of the panel method in the four-year cycle which makes it possible to analyze changes in social phenomena and in the period of time covered by the survey). The organization and methodology of the survey is governed by the Regulation (EC) No. 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). EU-SILC survey was implemented in the European Union in the years 2004-2007, and in Poland it has been conducted since 2005. The survey method - EU-SILC is a non-obligatory, representative questionnaire survey of individual households, carried out by the face-to-face interview technique. For individual interviews a proxy interview is allowed with another household member who is able to provide reliable information concerning the person who should be covered by the survey (this is applicable to the household members who are absent in the place of residence at the time of the survey). HLY indicator serves to measure the number of years that a person lives in a healthy condition. It combines information on age-specific mortality (age-specific deaths) and vulnerability to diseases (age-specific proportions of the population in healthy and unhealthy condition). A healthy condition is defined as one without limitation in everyday functioning and without disability. This statistical indicator is compiled separately for men and women. The Healthy Life Years (HLY) indicator is one of European Structural Indicators and refers to health as a factor connected with the development and well-being. HLY indicator has been developed as a result of observation that not all years, defined by expected length of life, are lived in a healthy condition. The HLY indicator level - as other measures of the expected health state - is calculated following the Sullivan method widely used since the 70s. The method is based on measures of frequency of disability in the population of a given age (the self-perceived disability) and on mortality tables.",

Health of the EU-SILC individual questionnaire). The survey covers adult persons aged 16 and more in a households. EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) is the instrument which focuses on providing current and comparable at the Member States level data on income, poverty, social exclusion, living conditions and health state. It is a questionnaire survey carried out every year (with the use of the panel method in the four-year cycle which makes it possible to analyze changes in social phenomena and in the period of time covered by the survey).The organization and methodology of the survey is governed by the Regulation (EC) No. 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). EU-SILC survey was implemented in the European Union in the years 2004-2007, and in Poland it has been conducted since 2005. The survey method - EU-SILC is a non-obligatory, representative questionnaire survey of individual households, carried out by the face-to-face interview technique. For individual interviews a proxy interview is allowed with another household member who is able to provide reliable information concerning the person who should be covered by the survey (this is applicable to the household members who are absent in the place of residence at the time of the survey). HLY indicator serves to measure the number of years that a person lives in a healthy condition. It combines information on age-specific mortality (age-specific deaths) and vulnerability to diseases (age-specific proportions of the population in healthy and unhealthy condition). A healthy condition is defined as one without limitation in everyday functioning and without disability. This statistical indicator is compiled separately for men and women. The Healthy Life Years (HLY) indicator is one of European Structural Indicators and refers to health as a factor connected with the development and well-being. HLY indicator has been developed as a result of observation that not all years, defined by expected length of life, are lived in a healthy condition. The HLY indicator level - as other measures of the expected health state - is calculated following the Sullivan method widely used since the 70s. The method is based on measures of frequency of disability in the population of a given age (the self-perceived disability) and on mortality tables.",

The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Lower secondary school educates the youth (aged 13-16) in a three-year cycle programme. Lower secondary education is compulsory. The formal requirement for admission to a lower secondary school is graduation from a primary school.",

The indicator is based on the EU Labour Force Survey (LFS). LFS is conducted on a quarterly basis. The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter.The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of  households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity – work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week:  1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paid employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture,  2) had work but did not perform it: (e.g. due to illness, maternity leave or vacation, a break in company activity) if the break in employment did not exceed 3 months; if the break was longer than 3 months in case when persons were paid employees the additional criterion is receiving during that period at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFS does not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in the establishment survey, i.a.:  a) employees living in lodging houses for workers,  b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers.",

The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allowspresenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers personsaged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity – work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e.performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree maincategories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. Theemployed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week: 1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paidemployees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economicactivity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or familyeconomic activity outside agriculture, 2) had work but did not perform it: (e.g. due to illness, maternity leave or vacation, a break incompany activity) if the break in employment did not exceed 3 months; if the break was longer than 3months in case when persons were paid employees the additional criterion is receiving during thatperiod at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. Among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whomenterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for aparticular job (if they receive a payment). Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFSdoes not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in theestablishment survey, i.a.: a) employees living in lodging houses for workers, b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers.",

The survey is conducted as continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15 and more who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons.The employed and unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15 years or more who during the reference week: 1) performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed as paid employees, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture,2) had work but did not perform it: (e.g. due to illness, maternity leave or vacation, a break in company activity) if the break in employment did not exceed 3 months; if the break was longer than 3 months in case when persons were paid employees the additional criterion is receiving during thatperiod at least 50% of the hitherto earnings. According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). Due to the survey methodological assumptions the number of the employed obtained from the LFS does not comprise some categories of persons, who are considered as employed in the establishment survey, i.a.: a) employees living in lodging houses for workers,b) employees working abroad for their Polish employers.",
