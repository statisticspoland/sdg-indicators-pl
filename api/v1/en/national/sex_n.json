                                      "methodology": "Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A crude population measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese. Body mass index (BMI) is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of the person's height in metres (kg/m2). For adults over 20 years old, BMI falls into one of the following categories:   18.5 - 24.9 - normal weight, 25.0 - 29.9 - pre-obesity, 30.0 - 34.9 - obesity class I, 35.0 - 39.9 - obesity class II, >=40 - obesity class III.  The BMI ranges are based on the effect excessive body fat has on disease and death and are reasonably well related to adiposity. BMI was developed as a risk indicator of disease; as BMI increases, so does the risk for some diseases. Some common conditions related to overweight and obesity include: premature death, cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, some cancers and diabetes. Data comes from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), repeated every 5 years. The results of the study enable to get to know the health situation of the inhabitants of the Union and its conditions in connection with the demographic and social characteristics and the place of residence. The study covers four areas:  health status (including self-assessment of health status, chronic diseases, limitations in functioning and their impact on everyday life, psychological well-being), health care (use of medical care, use of medicines, prophylaxis), health determinants (mainly lifestyle and exposure to adverse environmental factors) and demographic and social characteristics of persons and households.

Life tables illustrate both the average life expectancy and the potential pattern of extinction of the population. The source of data on death is the document of the Ministry of Health ”Death certificate” (basic document for civil status acts, which is in the part secondarily utilized by national statistics), data from the register of civil status and since 2015 — from PESEL register within the scope of additional data. Data on deaths are compiled in territorial division by place of registered for permanent stay of deceased person. Data on population were compiled on the basis of:  the balances of the residing population in a gmina based on the results of 2021 Population and Housing Census (for data since 2020) for previous years (2010 - 2019) on the basis of the 2011 Population and Housing Census, the registers of the Ministry of Interior - internal and international migration of population for permanent residence (since 2006 the presented data come from the Common Electronic System of Population Register - PESEL), documentation of Civil Status Offices regarding registered marriages, births and deaths.  Disability is estimated on the basis of variables obtained from the EU-SILC questionnaire survey (EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions), conducted annually since 2005.",

Life tables illustrate both the average life expectancy and the potential pattern of extinction of the population. The source of data on death is the document of the Ministry of Health ”Death certificate” (basic document for civil status acts, which is in the part secondarily utilized by national statistics), data from the register of civil status and since 2015 — from PESEL register within the scope of additional data. Data on deaths are compiled in territorial division by place of registered for permanent stay of deceased person. Data on population were compiled on the basis of:  the balances of the residing population in a gmina based on the results of 2021 Population and Housing Census (for data since 2020) for previous years (2010 - 2019) on the basis of the 2011 Population and Housing Census, the registers of the Ministry of Interior - internal and international migration of population for permanent residence (since 2006 the presented data come from the Common Electronic System of Population Register - PESEL), documentation of Civil Status Offices regarding registered marriages, births and deaths.

Due to the introduced changes, the full comparability of data on the fields of education with the data presented for the previous periods may not be possible.   Since the first quarter of 2018, the way of asking questions about participation in training/ education outside the formal education system has been changed, therefore the indicators in calculation of which the non-formal education is taken into account are not fully comparable with results from previous years."

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using the continuous observation method (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15-89, who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. The employment rate is the share of employed in a given category in the total population of the same category. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week: 1. performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed in a company/public institution or by a private employer, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture, 2. had work but did not perform it: • due to illness or holiday leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, childcare, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (work system or overtime collection), training related to the performed work • due to the seasonal character of the work, if they still regularly performed off-season their work or business conducting related tasks and responsibilities (excluding legal or administrative obligations) • for other reasons, if the anticipated break in employment did not exceed 3 months According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). The employed do not include: volunteers and interns who do not receive remuneration, people working in private engaged in the production of agricultural products solely or mainly for their own needs.",

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using the continuous observation method (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15-89,  who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. The scope of the survey does not include household members staying (the total actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective  households (such as: employee hotels, student dormitories, boarding houses, social care centres etc.) and the homeless. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e.performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the three maincategories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons. The employed, unemployed are the economically active population. Among the employed are included all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week:  performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed in a company/public institution or by a private employer, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in conducting family agricultural farm or family economic activity outside agriculture, had work but did not perform it:   due to illness or holiday leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, childcare, paternity or parental leave), organisation of working time (work system or overtime collection), training related to the performed work due to the seasonal character of the work, if they still regularly performed off-season their work or business conducting related tasks and responsibilities (excluding legal or administrative obligations) for other reasons, if the anticipated break in employment did not exceed 3 months  In accordance with international standards, among employees are also included apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). The employed do not include: volunteers and interns who do not receive remuneration, people working in private engaged in  the production of agricultural products solely or mainly for their own needs.",

In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons.The employed and unemployed are the economically active population.

The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis, using continuous observation (movable survey week) what allows presenting the situation on the labour market during a whole quarter. The survey covers persons aged 15-89 who are members of households in dwellings selected on a random basis. Outside the scope of the survey are members of households staying (the total duration of actual and planned stay is taken into account) 12 months or more abroad and in collective households (such as staff hotels, dormitories, boarding schools, nursing homes, etc.) and homeless people. In the context of economic activity - work is the main criterion in dividing the population, i.e. performing, holding or seeking work. According to the international standards, the tree main categories are distinguished: employed, unemployed and economically inactive persons.The employed and unemployed are the economically active population. The employed are defined as all persons aged 15-89 who during the reference week:  performed for at least one hour any work generating pay or income, i.e. were employed by a public company/institution or private employer,, worked on their own (or leased) agricultural farm, or conducted their own economic activity outside agriculture, assisted (without pay) in work on family agricultural farm or in conducting family economic activity outside agriculture, had work but did not perform it due to:   sickness, or rest leave, leave related to parenthood (maternity, parental, paternity or childcare), organization of working time (work system or overtime receipt), job-related training, the seasonal nature of the work, if they continued to regularly fulfill work or business-related tasks and duties (excluding legal or administrative duties) during the off-season, other reasons, if the expected period of absence from work does not exceed 3 months - did not exceed 3 months.  According to international standards, among employees are also included persons performing outwork and apprentices with whom enterprises or natural persons signed a contract for occupational training or learning skills for a particular job (if they receive a payment). The employed do not include: volunteers and unpaid interns, people working in individual agriculture engaged in the production of agricultural products exclusively or primarily for their own consumption. Unemployed persons are persons aged 15-74 who simultaneously fulfil three conditions: - within the reference week were not employed, - were actively looking for work, i.e. for over 4 weeks (the reference week being the fourth one) had been involved in concrete actions aimed at finding a job, - were available to take up work within two weeks after the reference week. Persons who were not seeking work because they had already found a job, were only waiting to start work within the period no longer than 3 months, and were available for this job are also included in the category of the unemployed.",
