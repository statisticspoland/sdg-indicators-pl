In addition, the data sources used in the calculations of the regional accounts have been reviewed in order to improve the estimation methods and the quality of the resulting data. A description of the changes introduced can be found in the 'Information of the Statistic Poland on the benchmarking revision in national accounts 1995-2022' of 10 October 2002', available here. The calculation of indicators based on revised data for 2010-2019 will be possible once the implementation of the benchmarking revision of regional accounts is completed. The indicator for 2023 has been calculated on the basis of preliminary data.",
