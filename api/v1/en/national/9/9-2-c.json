Product innovation is the introduction of a good or service that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This includes significant improvements in technical specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness or other functional characteristics. Product innovations can utilise new knowledge or technologies, or can be based on new uses or combinations of existing knowledge or technologies. Product innovations in services consist in the introduction of significant improvements in the way services are offered, adding new functions or features to existing services or introducing brand new services. Products to be included to innovation do not have to be new to the market in which the enterprise operates, but it must be new, at least for the enterprise itself.
