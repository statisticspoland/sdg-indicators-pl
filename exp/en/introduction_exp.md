        <p style="font-size: 16px;">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were defined in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/o_sdg" title="About Agenda for Sustainable Development" target="_blank">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a> and adopted in September 2015 by UN member states. The implementation of 17 SDGs (and the related 169 tasks) focuses on ensuring decent lives, worldwide peace and economic development based on a rational exploitation of the planet’s natural resources.</p>

        <div style="font-weight: bold">About SDG indicators</div>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">Tracking the progress in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda on a world scale is possible thanks to a set of 250 global indicators designed by the UN to monitor the 17 SDGs. At present, Polish official statistics provides data for nearly 70% of the SDG indicators listed by the UN (<a href="https://sdg.gov.pl/en" title="Platforma SDG" target="_blank">sdg.gov.pl/en</a>).</p>

        <div style="font-weight: bold">About experimental SDG indicators</div>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">Due to the wide scope of the SDGs, not all SDG measures are possible to obtain based on traditional data sources (e.g. surveys, reporting, censuses, registers). In order to fill in any information gaps, seeking new data sources for SDG indicators is a must. Statistics Poland conducts research and development work in this regard using non-traditional methods and new methodological approaches.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 16px;">In 2023, Statistics Poland developed the first experimental SDG indicators to assess sustainable development (published in 2024). For their calculation – depending on the type of indicator – various data sources were integrated, such as satellite remote sensing, geolocational data, and information from open databases. They focused on:</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;margin-left: 15px;">
           • access to roads in rural areas (Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure),<br />
           • convenient access to public transport (Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities),<br />
           • access to open public spaces (Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities),<br />
           • urban land management (Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities).</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">In 2024, Statistics Poland developed (and made available in 2025) additional experimental SDG indicators related to biodiversity, using geospatial analysis. These include:</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;margin-left: 15px;">
           • the percentage of terrestrial and surface water areas critical for biodiversity covered by protection (Goal 15: Life on Land),<br />
           • the percentage of key biodiversity areas in mountain regions covered by protection (Goal 15: Life on Land).</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">Work is underway to make further experimental SDG indicators available.</p>

        <div style="font-weight: bold">About the experimental SDG indicators website</div>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">A new tool for sharing experimental SDG statistics is being developed in response to the growing demand for SDG data that goes beyond the standard scope of information offered by statistics.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">To meet the recipients’ expectations, the experimental SDG statistics website contains:</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;margin-left: 15px;">• innovative SDG indicators in new cross sections,<br />
           • interactive visualisations in the form of maps and figures,<br />
           • interpretation, meaning and context for the new measures,<br />
           • data necessary for evidence-based decision-making.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">The tool's information resources and functionalities will be further developed – stay tuned to learn more about experimental SDG statistics.</p>
