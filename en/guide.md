            <h4>Our aproach to NRP</h4>
            <p>In order to conform with the UN's Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, the minimum characteristics an SDG NRP should have are that it should:
            <br />- is managed by national statistical offices;
            <br />- features official statistics and metadata according to established standard methodology;
            <br />- is publicly accessible;
            <br />- allows for feedback from data users;
            <br />- features <i> open source </i> (free) technology.

            <p>In addition, the Polish NRP reporting platform has been developed in accordance with accepted ones
            international guidelines, in particular for open data and software produced in the <i> open source model</i>.

            <h4>NRP - sources</h4>
            <p>Polish statistics actively supports the development of national reporting platforms, in particular
            produced in the open-source model for the purpose of monitoring SDGs indicators.
            Precursors in this field are USA and UK.<br />

            The current version of the Polish reporting platform has been developed based on earlier version of the US NRP,
            and was developed by us with new functionality and adapted to the needs of Polish statistics.
            <br />The project code is publicly available in the repository - <a href="#l"  target="_blank">
            https://github.com/statsticspoland/sdg-indicators-pl</a>
            </p>
            <p>
            The new universal version of the <b><i>open-sdg</i></b> platform developed by the US, UK and Center for Open Data Enterprise is available.
            <br />We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the national US, UK platforms for SDG and
            <a href="https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"  target="_blank">the project documentation</a>.
