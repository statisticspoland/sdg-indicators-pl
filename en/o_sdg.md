  <h4><b>ON THE 2030 AGENDA AND SDGs (SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS)</b></h4>

  <p><a target="_blank" title="Go to UN Agenda for Sustainable Development" href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/generalassembly/docs/globalcompact/A_RES_70_1_E.pdf">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>, adopted in September 2015, is a comprehensive plan of action for the world in a 2030 perspective, established by UN via negotiations amongst its member states. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda is an unprecedented event in the history of mankind. All 193 UN member states committed themselves to working for the realisation of  <a target="_blank" title="Go to UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals" href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">17 Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs</a>. The Goals are focused on ensuring decent lives, peace and economic progress for all people in the world while taking care of the natural environment and combating climate change.</p>
  <p>The 2030 Agenda is focused on five areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet (so-called 5Ps):</p>

  <p><b>People</b> are at the centre of the 2030 Agenda. Eradication of poverty and hunger amongst them, fulfilment of  their individual potential in dignity and equality as well as life in healthy environment are major challenges and prerequisites of sustainable development.</p>

  <p><b>Planet</b> should serve the needs of present and future generations. The rational use of natural resources, sustainable consumption and production, inclusive economic growth as well as climate action will help protect the planet from degradation and ensure intra- and intergenerational solidarity.</p>

  <p><b>Prosperity</b> should be provided to everyone through common improvement of life quality. Universal access to quality education, medical service as well as infrastructure in connection with environment-friendly economic and technological progress will enable the enjoyment of prosperous and fulfilling life.</p>

  <p><b>Peace</b> remains on guard of the 2030 Agenda realisation. The achievement of the Goals is possible only in societies free from violence and fear, based on tolerance and inclusion.</p>

  <p><b>Partnership</b> entails the necessity of mobilization of many environments. Global cooperation among all the countries, co-action of the government, business and civil society, in the spirit of solidarity with the poorest and most vulnerable, will enable the realisation of the ambitious vision of the 2030 Agenda.</p>

  <h4><b>SDG in EU & OECD</b></h4>

  <p><b>EU’s engagement with sustainable development</b></p>

  <p>The concept of sustainable development was present in the European Union long before the adoption of the 2030 Agenda. Sustainable development was acknowledged as EU’s principle of operation in the Treaty on European Union, whereas the detailed course of action for sustainable development in EU was outlined for the first time in the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS), adopted in 2001 and revised in 2006. The EU SDS goals were monitored by a relevant set of sustainable development indicators (SDIs).</p>

  <p>Joining the global initiative of the 2030 Agenda, the European Commission issued the communication <a target="_blank" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52016DC0739&from=PL" title="Go to issue">"Next steps for a sustainable European future. European action for sustainability"</a> in 2016. The document declared integration of SDGs into EU policy framework and regular reporting of progress towards SDGs. The global goals of the 2030 Agenda were mainstreamed into i.a. Europe 2020 Strategy, 10 Priorities of the European Commission and Circular Economy Package in force at that time. Currently, <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/international-strategies/sustainable-development-goals/eu-holistic-approach-sustainable-development_en" title="Go to report">EU holistic approach to SDGs</a> is reflected in i.a. <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024_en" title="Go to priorities">6 Commission Priorities for 2019-2024</a>, directly referring to 17 Sustainable Development Goals. However, SDGs figure most prominently in the 1st Commission Priority, namely, <a target="_blank" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:b828d165-1c22-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1.0002.02/DOC_1&format=PDF" title="Go to Green Deal">the European Green Deal </a> (communicated by EC in December, 2019), which is EU’s new development strategy aimed at transforming the EU into a modern, resource-efficient and climate neutral economy, where no person or region is left behind.</p>

  <p>In the EU, SDG monitoring is carried out by means of <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/database" title="Go to indicators">a set of about 100 sustainable development indicators</a> (SDIs). The EU set differs from the global one as it is strongly interlinked with EU policies, which are relevant to the development status and potential of Member States and challenges facing them. The EU SDIs rely heavily on the information resources of the European Statistical System. They are used i.a. for <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/publications" title="Go to Eurostat reports">Eurostat’s annual monitoring reports</a> on progress towards the SDGs in an EU context and <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/2020-european-semester-country-reports_en" title="Go to country reports">country reports</a> as part of the European Semester procedure for coordinating socio-economic and budgetary policy in the EU. </p>


  <p><b>OECD’s engagement with sustainable development</b></p>

  <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also takes an active part in sustainable development initiatives. In 2016, the Organization adopted "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/dac/Better%20Policies%20for%202030.pdf" title="Go to action plan">An OECD Action Plan on the Sustainable Development Goals</a> ", identifying four main areas for OECD activities. One of them is supporting OECD countries in reviewing their policies in terms of SDGs and mapping them with SDGs. Conclusions from these reviews are presented in an OECD series <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/better-policies_23081392" title="Go to publications">Better Policies</a>, including, among others, a publication on Poland ("<a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/the-2030-sustainable-development-agenda_9789264287341-en" title="Go to agenda">The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Towards a Successful Implementation by Poland</a>").</p>

  <p>In addition, the OECD supports countries in mainstreaming SDGs into their policies in order to ensure better coherence with the 2030 Agenda and, as a result, coordination in SDG implementation. With that aim, the Organization prepared <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/gov/pcsd/oecd-recommendation-on-policy-coherence-for-sustainable-development.htm" title="Go to policy">OECD Recommendation on Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development</a> (PCSD) based on three main pillars (a strategic vision for enhancing policy cohesion, effective governance and evaluation of actions) and eight specific principles for adjusting national priorities to the 2030 Agenda.</p>

  <p>Another SDG activity, resulting from "An OECD Action Plan...", refers to SDG distance assessment in OECD countries. Every few years, under the initiative <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/wise/measuring-distance-to-the-sdgs-targets.htm" title="Go to report">Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets</a>, the OECD publishes reports presenting detachment of OECD countries from the full realization of the targets and goals, based on UN and OECD data.</p>

  <p>Apart from that, OECD provides specialized <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/about/civil-society/sdgs/" title="Go to tools">tools</a> for tracking progress towards the SDGs:</p>
  <p>•	SDG monitoring framework for OECD regions and cities (Measuring the distance to the SDGs in regions and cities),</p>
  <p>•	instrument for measuring financial support for SDGs (SDG Financing Lab),</p>
  <p>•	browser for connections between policies, challenges and SDGs (SDG Pathfinder).</p>

  <p>The remaining OECD activities related to sustainable development include i.a.:</p>
  <p>•	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/wise/better-life-initiative.htm" title="Go to better life initiative">Better Life Initiative</a> – OECD’s project promoting better policies in line with the phrase "Better policies for better lives." The initiative engages the political world into actions aimed at fostering well-being, and enhances social engagement. Development of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/11111111111" title="Go to index">Better Life Index</a>, enabling a comprehensive view of societal well-being issue, was part of the project. Results of the latest research on life quality are presented in successive editions of the thematic publication <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/wise/how-s-life-23089679.htm" title="Go to publications">„How’s life? Measuring Well-being.</a>"</p>
  <p>•	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/" title="Go to publications">Green growth and sustainable development</a> – actions towards policy enhancement for economic growth, while preserving natural environment assets and developing environment-friendly infrastructure. OECD’s activity in the area of green growth is based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/towards-green-growth-9789264111318-en.htm" title="Go to strategy"> Green Growth Strategy</a>, adopted in 2011. Progress made by individual countries in implementing economic and environmental priorities, outlined in the Strategy, is presented in the successive editions of the publication <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/env/towards-green-growth-9789264234437-en.htm" title="Go to publication">„Towards Green Growth? Tracking Progress"</a>. </p>

  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="stat" style="scroll-margin-top: 500px;">
  <h4><b>OFFICIAL STATISTICS FOR SDGs</b></h4>

  <p>The task of official statistics, indicated in the 2030 Agenda, is to monitor progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The monitoring is carried out on the three following levels:</p>
  <p>•	global – this level is coordinated by The United Nations Statistical Commission,</p>
  <p>•	world regions – the responsibility for them lies with the UN regional commissions (as for Poland, it is the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe – UNECE),</p>
  <p>•	national – national statistical offices are accountable for this level (in Poland, it is Statistics Poland – GUS).</p>

  <p>In order to assess progress on the global and regional level, a set of so-called <a target="_blank" href="https://sdg.gov.pl/en/faqs/" title="Go to faqs">global</a> (<a target="_blank" href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/" title="Go to indicator list">SDG indicators</a>). is used. Indicator values for the whole world and its regions are calculated by international organizations, mainly on the basis of official statistical data obtained from individual countries. On the national level, instead of global indicators, countries can use their own sets of indicators for monitoring areas and issues of greatest relevance to them. This approach has been adopted in Poland (see – <a target="_blank" href="https://sdg.gov.pl/en/faqs/" title="Go to faqs">the indicator set monitoring national priorities</a>). The indicators for <a target="_blank" href="https://sdg.gov.pl/en/priorytet/" title="Go to national priorities">national priorities</a> were made available for the first time in 2018. As a result of further development work, the set have been updated and related more closely to the national priorities within SDGs. The current set of indicators is available <a target="_blank" href="https://sdg.gov.pl/en/statistics_nat/" title="Go to national indicators">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Progress made on the global and regional scale is presented in annual UN reports, available on <a target="_blank" href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/" title="Go to UN website">UN website</a> in the "Reports" tab. In addition to that, a global <a target="_blank" href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal" title="Go to database">database</a> is available for users searching for detailed information on the world, regions and individual countries. Actions undertaken by individual countries are monitored within <a target="_blank" href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/vnrs/" title="Go to VNR">Voluntary National Reviews – VNR</a>, conducted every year in July at the UN High-Level Political Forum in New York. In 2018, Poland conducted its first national review. As an institution responsible for indicator framework and provision of necessary statistical information, Statistics Poland took part in preparing a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.pl/web/rozwoj-technologia/monitoring-realizacji-agendy-2030" title="Go to report">report</a> on Poland’s progress.</p>

  <h4><b>STATISTICS POLAND’S ACTIVITY FOR SDGs IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA</b></h4>

  <p>Monitoring progress towards the realization of the 2030 Agenda is a great challenge for the official statistics. It requires coordination of many institutions’ activities and cooperation between the international and national level.
  </p>

  <p>Statistics Poland actively participates in international work on the development of the monitoring system for the Sustainable Development Goals, representing the Eastern Europe region in <a target="_blank" href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/" title="Go to group description">the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators</a> (IAEG-SDGs) operating within the United Nations. At the same time, Statistics Poland is a member of the IAEG-SDGs Task Team on Lessons Learned from global SDG monitoring, whose role is to evaluate this process and formulate recommendations for future development monitoring frameworks beyond 2030.
  </p>

  <p>In order to provide strategic leadership in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda (in terms of SDG monitoring and reporting) at the international level, <a target="_blank" href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg/" title="Go to group description">the High-level Group for Partnership, Coordination and Capacity-Building for statistics for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a> (HLG-PCCB) was established within the UN. From 2021 to 2025, Statistics Poland was a member of the HLG-PCCB Group, representing the entire Eastern Europe region in the Group. In addition to setting strategic goals in SDG monitoring, the Group's tasks also include developing statistical capacity, searching for new data sources and building partnerships for the SDGs, as well as organizing the <a target="_blank" href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/undataforum/index.html" title="Go to World Data Forum">World Data Forum</a>.
  </p>

  <p>So as to support statistical institutions in the UNECE region, the <a target="_blank" href="https://unece.org/statistics/networks-of-experts/ces-steering-group-statistics-sustainable-development-goals" title="Go to group information">Steering Group on Statistics for Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SG on SDGs) was established in 2016 (within the Conference of European Statisticians – CES). The primary task of the Group is to support the national statistical offices of the UNECE region in implementing solutions to measure and monitor sustainable development goals. From 2018 to 2025, Poland (Statistics Poland) co-chaired the Group's work (together with Sweden). As a regular member of SG on SDGs, Statistics Poland actively participates in work done by the task teams established by the Steering Group. One of the Group’s greatest achievements is preparation of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=47510" title="Go to road map">Road Map on statistics for Sustainable Development Goals</a>, which facilitates organization of the 2030 Agenda monitoring.
  </p>

  <p>In 2022, the <a target="_blank" href="https://unece.org/statistics/publications/CES-roadmap-sdg-2" title="Go to road map">Road Map on Statistics for Sustainable Development Goals – Second Edition</a> was released, based on gained experiences on the monitoring of the SDGs in the UNECE region and new challenges for the official statistics in this context. Poland (Statistics Poland) is the leading author of the two sections of the publication (Tracking progress at various levels & Voluntary National Reviews). The second edition of the road map presents also two <a target="_blank" href="https://unece.org/statistics/rm-country-case-studies" title="Go to case studies">case studies</a> based on experiences of Statistics Poland (i.a. participation in development of SDG indicators for business <a target="_blank" href="https://sdg.gov.pl/en/o_sdg/#bis" title="Go to Impact Barometer">Impact Barometer</a>).
  </p>

  <p>In 2024, the Steering Group, with the active participation of Poland, developed an addendum to the Road Map (<a target="_blank" href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2024-12/Data Availability - Addendum to the Road Map_FINAL_withcovers.pdf" title="Go to an addendum to the Road Map">Road Map on Statistics for SDGs Addendum to the 2nd edition: Guidance on Assessing and Conceptualizing SDG Indicator Availability</a>). It contains practical guidelines for monitoring the availability of global SDG indicators at the national level, as well as a review of the definition of "availability" concept in this context. Based on the assumptions outlined in the addendum, the Steering Group developed and released another product (primarily aimed at statistical offices): a tool for measuring the availability of SDG data at the national level (<a target="_blank" href="https://unece.org/statistics/documents/2024/03/2024-self-assessment-tool-sdg-indicator-availability" title="Go to a tool for measuring the availability of SDG data at the national level">2024 Self-Assessment Tool for Indicator Availability</a>). Polish representatives played a significant role in the development of this tool. Before its release, the tool was tested at Statistics Poland, where the availability of indicators was assessed from the perspective of Polish experience. The results of the pilot test were described in a case study titled <a target="_blank" href="https://unece.org/statistics/documents/2024/09/informal-documents/poland-analysis-global-indicator-availability" title="Go to a case study">Poland: Analysis of global indicator availability on the national level – pilot testing of the 2024 Self-Assessment Tool for Indicator Availability</a>.
  </p>

  <p>In addition, the Roadmap is complemented by the <a target="_blank" href="https://w3.unece.org/SDG/en" title="Go to UNECE Regional Platform on Statistics for SDGs">UNECE Regional Platform on Statistics for SDGs</a> to showcase progress on monitoring the 17 Goals in the UNECE region and provide easy access to SDG indicators with data for countries in the region.
  </p>

  <p>In 2025, within the Steering Group, a document was developed for the CES in-depth review titled: <a target="_blank" href="https://unece.org/statistics/documents/2025/02/working-documents/halfway-2030-lessons-learned-providing-statistics" title="Go to CES in-depth review document">Halfway to 2030 – lessons learned from providing statistics for Sustainable Development Goals</a> under Poland’s leadership. Its aim was to identify challenges related to ensuring SDG statistics at the halfway point of the 2030 Agenda (primarily at the national level) and to formulate recommendations for the CES Bureau (for undertaking specific actions) in response to the identified issues. The in-depth review focused on four areas considered key in monitoring the SDGs within National Statistical Offices (NSOs) – measurement of progress; coordination, cooperation and partnerships; data communication; and innovation.
  </p>

  <h4><b>STATISTICS POLAND’S PARTNERSHIPS FOR SDGs</b></h4>

  <p>Statistics Poland’s activities within SDG monitoring are recognized by various circles which, as a consequence, invite Polish official statistics to cooperate in initiatives related to the 2030 Agenda. Examples of such cooperation include:</p>

  <p>•	Invitation of Statistics Poland to co-organize the event <a target="_blank" href="https://stat.gov.pl/wydarzenia/wydarzenia-miedzynarodowe/wydarzenie-harnessing-remote-sensing-for-sustainable-cities,6,1.html" title="Go to event">Harnessing Remote Sensing for Sustainable Cities</a> (within the Road to Bern series of meetings, preceding the World Data Forum in Bern), devoted to innovative methods and solutions in sustainable urban development, using new data sources, including remote sensing,</p>
  <p>•	Statistics Poland’s participation in the development of the <a target="_blank" href="https://sdg.gov.pl/en/o_sdg/#bis" title="Go to business indicators">Impact Barometer</a> – the first tool in Poland that allows companies to measure their individual contribution to the SDGs independently and free of charge,</p>
  <p>•	Statistics Poland, at the invitation of the UN Global Compact, joined the preparation of a report entitled <a target="_blank" href="https://ungc.org.pl/raport-edukacja-klimatyczna-w-polsce/" title="Go to report">„Climate Education in Poland"</a>; the report gathers information constituting a starting point for a debate on climate education in the Polish educational system; one of the chapters is devoted to the presentation of the sources of climate knowledge, where there is a section devoted to the information offer of the official statistics,</p>
  <p>•	participation of Statistics Poland in a nationwide consumer campaign <a target="_blank" href="https://dobrecele.pl" title="Go to campaign">Good Goals</a> which aims to familiarize Polish consumers with the Sustainable Development Goals and encourage them to take action in their daily lives to achieve the Agenda 2030; as part of the campaign, an <a target="_blank" href="https://dobrecele.pl/dobre-cele/" title="Go to portal">information portal</a> was created addressed to the Polish consumer about the various objectives of sustainable development, based, inter alia, on SDG statistics, made available by Polish NSO on the <a target="_blank" href="https://sdg.gov.pl/en/" title="Go to SDG platform">SDG Platform</a> and in <a target="_blank" href="https://raportsdg.stat.gov.pl/en/index.html" title="Go to reports"> digital SDG reports.</a></p>

  </div>

  <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="bis" style="scroll-margin-top: 500px;">
  <h4><b>BUSINESS INDICATORS</b></h4>

    <div>
    <p>Entrepreneurs have a special impact on sustainable development, though it is hard to measure. Global indicators for monitoring countries and world’s progress towards the SDGs are not fit for business purposes. </p>

    <p>That is the reason why we offer <a href="https://kampania17celow.pl/barometrwplywu/"  title="Go to Impact Barometr on kampania17celow.pl" target="_blank">Impact Barometer</a> to entrepreneurs – a free-of-charge tool for enterprise self-assessment of its contribution to sustainable development. Whereas the aggregated measurement results will give a picture of Polish business impact on the SDGs. The tool is a set of indicators relevant to business specifics with instructions how to calculate them. It was developed under <a href="https://kampania17celow.pl/the-17-goals-campaign/" target="_blank" title="Go to kampania17celow.pl">the 17 Goals Campaign</a> with substantive support from Statistics Poland and in cooperation with business and academic experts.</p>

  <p><b>The Sustainable Development Goals Report</b></p>

  <p>The report reviews progress in the following years of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2025 edition details the significant challenges the world is facing in making substantial strides towards achieving the SDGs based on the latest data and estimates. It features areas with setbacks (e.g. ongoing inequalities, hunger, lack of access to water and sanitation, insufficient support for women and persons with disabilities, climate change, debt, rising living costs, and inadequate financing for development efforts) while also showcasing where tangible progress has been made (e.g. a decline in new HIV infections, improved access to energy and the Internet, increased enrollment of children in education, and biodiversity improvement). The 2025 report also highlights where action needs to be accelerated including: energy transition, digitalization, education, and climate protection – as well as the need for stronger multilateralism.</p>

  <p>The Sustainable Development Report (SDR), developed by Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UN SDSN) and the Bertelsmann Stiftung, reviews progress on SDGs made each year by UN Member States. The SDR contains the SDG index and SDG dashboard, tools allowing the assessment of each country’s overall performance on the SDGs and identifying country's strengths and weaknesses in relation to the 17 Goals both with the global trends in this area.</p>

  <p><b>Road Map on Statistics for Sustainable Development Goals – Second Edition</b></p>

  <p>The Road Map provides guidance on how to organize the process of the 2030 Agenda monitoring in the UNECE region. Its first edition (2017) lays out the foundations and frames for tracking SDGs, whereas the second edition – sums up conclusions and experiences in that area, gained by countries in the UNECE region so far, and presents challenges currently faced by statistical systems:</p>
  <p>• data disaggregation and searching for new data sources to provide information on vulnerable and marginalized groups in line with <em>Leave No One Behind</em> principle,
  <br>• SDG monitoring tailored to user needs (subnational level, private sector),
  <br>• implementation of solutions facilitating monitoring: Application Programming Interface (API) and uniform data transmission format (SDG-SDMX),
  <br>• statistical production under pandemic circumstances.</p>
  <p>The Road Map was prepared by the Steering Group on Statistics for SDGs, established in February 2016 by the CES Bureau within the UN Economic Commission for Europe. The Group was co-chaired by Poland and Sweden from 2018 to 2025.</p>
  <p>Poland’s representatives played an in important part in developing of the Road Map as its editors and authors of two sections in it (Beyond global monitoring and Voluntary National Reviews). The publication also includes examples of Polish initiatives (<a title="Go to examples of Polish initiatives" href="https://unece.org/statistics/rm-country-case-studies" target="_blank">case studies</a>) i.a. Statistics Poland’s involvement in development of SDG indicators for business (<a title="Go to Impact Barometer" href="https://sdg.gov.pl/en/o_sdg/#bis" target="_blank">Impact Barometer</a>).</p>

  <p>The publication, issued by Eurostat annually since 2017, present progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by the EU and its member states. The reports consider two periods: the short term, accounting for progress over the past five years, and the long term, looking at the trends over the last 15 years. The analysis presented in the reports is based on a set of about 100 SDG indicators (structured along the 17 SDGs and closely linked to EU policies), available in the <a title="Go to Eurostat SDG database" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/overview" target="_blank">Eurostat database</a>.</p>
  <p>The 2025 edition of the report presents the EU’s progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), analysing EU actions and their impact across social, economic, environmental, and institutional dimensions. The report also compares the EU’s performance with other major economies and examines the global spillover effects of EU consumption. The publication is accompanied by a communication package, including new visual and interactive tools available on the <a title="Go to Eurostat SDG database" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/overview" target="_blank">Eurostat</a> website — notably the latest <a title="Go to SDG EU Progress Tracker" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/visualisations/sdg-eu-progress-tracker/" target="_blank">SDG EU Progress Tracker</a>.</p>

  <p><b>The Short and Winding Road to 2030 - Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets</b></p>

  <p>The publication assesses the distance that OECD countries need to travel to meet SDG targets. It is based on the IAEG Global Indicator List and using data from the <a title="Go to UN SDG Database" href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal" target="_blank">UN SDG Database</a> and <a title="Go to OECD SDG Database" href="https://www.oecd.org/statistics/listofoecddatabases.htm" target="_blank">OECD Databases</a>.</p>
  <p>The latest edition of the report <em>The Short and Winding Road to 2030: Measuring Distance to the SDG Targets</em> evaluates the direction and pace of SDG realization in OECD countries, but it goes one step further and deepens the analysis by identifying long-term trends, considering also how these trends may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The publication is supplemented with country profiles including information on country strengths and weaknesses in terms of SDGs as well as the distance they need to travel to meet the SDG targets.

  <p><b>A Territorial Approach to the Sustainable Development Goals. Synthesis report</b></p>

  <p>The publication argues that cities and regions play a critical role in the achievement of sustainable development goals. It estimates that at least 105 of the 169 SDG targets will not be reached without proper engagement of OECD cities and regions. With reference to SDGs, the report analyzes, in parallel, the impact of global megatrends (demographic change, climate change, digitalization and so-called "geography of discontent") manifesting in different forms depending on local and regional circumstances. The main body of the report includes an OECD localized indicator framework that measures the distance towards the SDGs for cities and regions in OECD countries.

  <p><b>How’s Life? 2024. Well-being and resilience in times of crisis</b></p>


  <p>The publication <em>How's Life?</em> describes the latest data on people’s well-being, the state of the environment, and prospects for future generations in OECD and partner countries. The publication examines how successive crises – the pandemic, the cost-of-living surge, and climate change – have affected quality of life, highlighting growing material and social inequalities, challenges related to mental health, social trust, and societal resilience. Based on over 80 well-being indicators, the report serves as a tool to support policy-making aimed at more inclusive and sustainable development.</p>

  <p><b>SDGs & me</b></p>

  <p>A new digital publication by Eurostat on the 2030 Agenda’s goals reaches out to a wide range of readers. Its intuitive nature and attractive layout encourage each and everyone to take a glance at the SDGs from the statistical point of view. <em>SDGs & me</em> presents progress towards 17 goals in the EU and its member countries by means of interactive visualizations. In order to assess progress in achieving the global goals, metrics from Eurostat’s SDG indicator set were used. The publication enables comparison of progress towards the SDGs between the countries and against the EU. It also makes it possible to guess trends for indicator values before their presentation on the chart.</p>
