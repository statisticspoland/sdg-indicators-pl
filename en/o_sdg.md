  <h4><b>ON THE 2030 AGENDA AND SDGs (SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS)</b></h4>

  <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&Lang=E">The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>, adopted in September 2015, is a comprehensive plan of action for the world in a 2030 perspective, established by UN via negotiations amongst its member states. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda is an unprecedented event in the history of mankind. All 193 UN member states committed themselves to working for the realisation of  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">17 Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs</a>. The Goals are focused on ensuring decent lives, peace and economic progress for all people in the world while taking care of the natural environment and combating climate change.</p>
  <p>The 2030 Agenda is focused on five areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet (so-called 5Ps):</p>

  <p><b>People</b> are at the centre of the 2030 Agenda. Eradication of poverty and hunger amongst them, fulfilment of  their individual potential in dignity and equality as well as life in healthy environment are major challenges and prerequisites of sustainable development.</p>

  <p><b>Planet</b> should serve the needs of present and future generations. The rational use of natural resources, sustainable consumption and production, inclusive economic growth as well as climate action will help protect the planet from degradation and ensure intra- and intergenerational solidarity.</p>

  <p><b>Prosperity</b> should be provided to everyone through common improvement of life quality. Universal access to quality education, medical service as well as infrastructure in connection with environment-friendly economic and technological progress will enable the enjoyment of prosperous and fulfilling life.</p>

  <p><b>Peace</b> remains on guard of the 2030 Agenda realisation. The achievement of the Goals is possible only in societies free from violence and fear, based on tolerance and inclusion.</p>

  <p><b>Partnership</b> entails the necessity of mobilization of many environments. Global cooperation among all the countries, co-action of the government, business and civil society, in the spirit of solidarity with the poorest and most vulnerable, will enable the realisation of the ambitious vision of the 2030 Agenda.</p>

  <h4><b>SDG in EU & OECD</b></h4>

  <p><b>EU’s engagement with sustainable development  </b></p>

  <p>The course of action for sustainable development in EU was outlined for the first time in the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS), adopted in 2001 and revised in 2006. The EU SDS goals were monitored by a relevant set of sustainable development indicators (SDIs).</p>
  <p>Joining the global initiative of the 2030 Agenda, the European Commission issued the communication ‘Next steps for a sustainable European future’ in 2016. The document declared integration of SDGs in EU policy framework and regular reporting of the progress in SDGs implementation. Taking into account that EU development priorities were determined in i.a.  Europe 2020 Strategy, 10 Priorities of the European Commission and Circular Economy Package, a special set of <a target="_blank" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/sdi/main-tables">100 indicators</a> was adopted for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals, different from the UN set of SDG indicators and consistent with challenges faced by EU member states. The set fully relies on the statistical resources of the European Statistical System.</p>

  <p><b>OECD’s engagement with sustainable development </b></p>
  <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development also takes an active part in the sustainable development initiatives, including the 2030 Agenda realisation. OECD supports its member states in SDGs implementation through i.a. assistance with domestic resource mobilisation as well as  policy review and its adjustment to specific Goals. Among the most important OECD’s initiatives are Better Life Initiative as well as Green growth and Sustainable development, both adopted in 2011. </p>

  <p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/statistics/better-life-initiative.htm">Better Life Initiative </a></b>– OECD’s project promoting better policies in line with the phrase ‘Better policies for better lives.’ The initiative engages the political world into actions aimed at fostering well-being, and enhances social engagement. Development of Better Life Index, enabling a comprehensive view of  societal well-being issue, was part of the project. Results of the latest research on life quality are presented in successive editions of the thematic publication How’s life? Measuring Well-being.</p>

  <p><b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/">Green growth and Sustainable development </a></b>– actions towards policy enhancement for economic growth, while preserving natural environment assets and developing environment-friendly infrastructure. OECD’s activity in the area of green growth is based on the Green Growth Strategy, adopted in 2011. Progress made by individual countries in implementing economic and environmental priorities, outlined in the Strategy, is presented in the successive editions of the publication Towards Green Growth? Tracking Progress.</p>

  <h4><b>OFFICIAL STATISTICS FOR SDGs</b></h4>
  <p>The task of official statistics, indicated in the 2030 Agenda, is to monitor progress in achieving
the Sustainable Development Goals. The monitoring is carried out on the three following levels:
</p>
<p>•	global – this level is coordinated by The United Nations Statistical Commission;</p>
<p>•	world regions – the responsibility for them lies with the UN regional commissions (as for Poland, it is the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe – UNECE);</p>
<p>•	national – national statistical offices are accountable for this level (in Poland, it is Statistics Poland – GUS). </p>
<p>In order to assess progress on the global and regional level, a set of so-called  <a href="http://sdg.gov.pl/en/faqs/">global</a> (<a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/">SDG indicators</a>). is used. Indicator values for the whole world and its regions are calculated by international organizations, mainly on the basis of official statistical data obtained from individual countries. On the national level, instead of global indicators, countries can use their own sets of indicators for monitoring areas and issues of greatest relevance to them. This approach has been adopted in Poland (see – <a href="http://sdg.gov.pl/faqs/"> the indicator set monitoring national priorities</a>). The indicators for national priorities were made available for the first time in 2018. As a result of further development work, the set have been updated and related more closely to the national priorities within SDGs. The current set of indicators is available <a href="http://sdg.gov.pl/en/statistics_nat/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Progress made on the global and regional scale is presented in annual UN <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2018/"  target="_blank">reports</a>. In addition to that,
a global <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/"  target="_blank">database</a>. is available for users searching for detailed information on the world, regions and individual countries. Actions undertaken by individual countries are monitored within (<a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/vnrs/"  target="_blank">Voluntary National Reviews – VNR</a>), conducted every year in July at the UN High-Level Political Forum in New York. In 2018, Poland conducted its first national review. As an institution responsible for indicator framework and provision of necessary statistical information, Statistics Poland took part in preparing a <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/przedsiebiorczosc-technologia/monitoring-realizacji-agendy-2030"  target="_blank">report</a> on Poland’s progress.</p>

<p>Monitoring progress in the realisation of the 2030 Agenda is a great challenge for official statistics. It requires coordination of many institutions’ activities and cooperation between the international and national level. So as to support statistical institutions in the UNECE region, the Steering Group on Statistics for Sustainable Development Goals was established. Since 2018, the Group has been co-chaired by Poland (GUS). One of the Group’s greatest achievements is preparation of (<a href="http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=47510"  target="_blank">Road Map on statistics for Sustainable Development Goals</a>), which facilitates organization of the 2030 Agenda monitoring.</p>
